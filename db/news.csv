171,Meduza EN,"‘They tried to break him, but they went too far’. Last year, a young Russian conscript was found hanged in the forest. The army says it was suicide — but his mother isn't buying it.",https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/04/28/they-tried-to-break-him-but-they-went-too-far,2025-04-28 17:37:26,"<p>In the spring of 2024, a 20-year-old Russian conscript named Kirill Poluyanov was found hanged in a forest near a military base outside the city of Ulan-Ude. Military police and investigators claim that he took his own life, but Kirill’s mother, Anastasia Poluyanova, is convinced that her son was killed by his fellow soldiers. One of them told her that Kirill was brutally bullied and extorted by the other servicemen — and that hazing is widespread at the base. Independent forensic experts have also questioned the official account of his death. Journalists from the outlet People of Baikal <a href=""https://baikal-journal.ru/2025/04/24/ya-sebe-armiyu-po-drugomu-predstavlyal/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">spoke to</a> Anastasia about her efforts to uncover the truth about her son’s death. Meduza shares an abridged translation of their story.</p>
  <h3>‘I was afraid he'd end up at war’</h3>
  <p>On the morning of June 26, 2024, Anastasia Poluyanova woke up to a message from Ksenia, her son Kirill's girlfriend. It was a forwarded message from Kirill, which included a geolocation tag. It read: ""Forgive me, my sunshine. I can’t do this anymore. Tell my mom I love her. He won’t let me go — he says I have to.""</p>
  <p>Together with her cousin, Anastasia got in her car and drove to the tagged location. After hours of searching for Kirill with no success, they called his unit and asked for help. That evening, Anastasia was told the military unit had found her son. He was dead, hanging by a belt tied to a tree branch, about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the base.</p>
  <figure><img src=""https://meduza.io/image/attachments/images/011/278/348/small/Afnon32yC0UGViGDqcWRow"" /><figcaption>Kirill Poluyanov in college</figcaption></figure>
  <p>Before he joined the military, Kirill worked at a meat processing plant. According to his mother, the pay was decent — around 3,350 rubles ($40) a day. “Now the military’s spreading rumors that he had debts and that’s why he supposedly took his own life. It’s all lies,” she says. “He had money. I know that for sure — we shared an online bank account, and his balance never dropped below 50,000 rubles ($600).”</p>
  <p>Kirill could have been exempt from the army because of his allergies and scoliosis. But on April 22, 2024, he passed his medical exam at the draft office and was assigned Category A — fit for duty. Two days later, he was posted to Military Unit No. 32364, just outside Ulan-Ude.</p>
  <p>“Of course I didn’t want him going into the army,” Anastasia Poluyanova tells People of Baikal. “I was afraid he’d end up at war. Afraid he’d sign that contract. But I didn’t cry. It was his decision — he was a grown man.”</p>
  <p>She felt a little better when she learned Kirill would be stationed just two kilometers (six miles) from home. “I was actually relieved,” Anastasia recalls. “We could go visit him, and they said he might even be allowed home on weekends.”</p>
  <h3>‘At least I’ll come out of it a man’</h3>
  <p>In May 2024, Kirill ran away from his unit for the first time. It happened just a few days after his first visit with his mother. His superiors found him quickly and, instead of taking him straight back to his unit, they first brought him home. His commander told Anastasia, “Don’t scold him,” and waited outside while she fed her son.</p>
  <p>By then, Anastasia already knew that hazing was rampant in the unit. During their first visit, Kirill had told her that “all the newcomers are abused by the sergeants.”</p>
  <p>“As soon as they stepped through the door, they were bullied — called names, kicked, slapped on the back of the head,” Anastasia recalls him saying. “Kirill said to me, ‘This isn’t what I imagined the army would be like.’” Before Kirill returned to the unit, his girlfriend Ksenia slipped him a touchscreen phone — something soldiers weren’t allowed to have.</p>
  <p>Later, Anastasia noticed Kirill behaving strangely during their visits. “He kept looking around, like he was scared. I think they must have threatened him, told him not to say anything,” she says. She tried to persuade him to leave the army, but he always answered, “No, I’ll see it through. At least I’ll come out of it a man.”</p>

  <p>In early June, Kirill was admitted to the medical unit with a respiratory infection. After he recovered, his commander assigned him to work there as a clerk. Kirill called his mother, excited. “I’ve got such good news, I can’t wait to tell you!” he said.</p>
  <p>But the job turned out to be nothing like he expected. According to Anastasia, her son wasn’t given enough time to rest — they made him paint, whitewash, plaster, repair equipment, and clean the grounds. The medical unit was preparing for an inspection ahead of the oath ceremony, and most of the prep work fell on Kirill. His mother remembers he looked exhausted and was counting down the days until the ceremony.</p>
  <p>The whole Poluyanov family was preparing for the big event too. “After the ceremony, everyone who lived nearby was supposed to get leave,” Anastasia says. “We invited friends over and planned a real celebration. We even bought an inflatable pool and set it up in the yard.”</p>
  <p>Looking back on those plans, she adds: “Even if he had decided to do this to himself… he would have come home first. He would have come for sure. Even if he’d had thoughts of suicide, he would have pushed them aside while he came home.”</p>

  <h3>‘The dogs were barking like crazy’</h3>
  <p>On the night Kirill died, his mother couldn’t sleep. She stayed out walking late into the night. “I wasn’t feeling anxious,” Anastasia recalls. “I just couldn’t sleep for some reason. It started raining during the night. My cousin and I stood outside for a while, smoking in the rain, then we went back inside. In the morning, I decided not to take my youngest daughter to kindergarten, so I slept in a little longer.” (Besides Kirill, the Poluyanov family has two daughters: the older one is 16, the younger is five.)</p>
  <p>When Anastasia read the forwarded message from Ksenia the next morning, she immediately tried calling her son, but there was no answer — just a dial tone. Within five minutes, she and her cousin were in the car, searching for Kirill based on his last known location. The geolocation signal led them to a Buddhist temple deep in the forest.</p>
  <p>“We went back there several times because the location kept pointing right to the temple,” Anastasia says. “Next to it, there’s a house where an elderly man and woman live. The woman told us the dogs were barking like crazy around 4:00 a.m., which means someone must have been nearby. But she didn’t go outside because it was raining.”</p>
  <p>By around 10:00 a.m., Anastasia couldn’t take it anymore and called the military unit. They confirmed that Kirill was missing.</p>
  <p>The family spent the entire day searching for him and contacting the military police, but received no help. That evening, Anastasia heard from friends that a lot of military vehicles had gathered on a hill not far from where they had searched that morning.</p>
  <h4>How Russia lured Nepali fighters into the war in Ukraine</h4><ul><li><a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/08/21/the-worst-decision-you-can-make""><b>‘The worst decision you can make’</b> How Russia lured hundreds of men from Nepal to fight in Ukraine, leaving many of their families in financial ruin</a></li></ul>
  <p>Still, the first official word came from Ksenia. “She said, ‘They found Kirill,’” Anastasia recalls. “I was so relieved. I said, ‘Thank God! Where is he?’ And she answered, ‘He hanged himself.’”</p>
  <p>When Kirill’s parents arrived at the scene, they found the area cordoned off. Anastasia remembers demanding to be let through. She says she was “screaming like a madwoman,” but military police blocked her from reaching the place where the body was found. The investigative team didn’t arrive until 10:00 p.m. that night. Kirill’s father volunteered to do the formal identification — they wouldn’t let Anastasia in.</p>
  <p>According to Anastasia, her husband immediately noticed that the boots on Kirill’s body were loosely hanging off his feet and his uniform looked far too big, as if it belonged to someone else. It was also strange that Kirill had no personal belongings on him — not even a pack of cigarettes, even though he was a heavy smoker. But those weren’t the only things that immediately convinced Anastasia that her son had been killed inside the unit and then dumped in the forest.</p>
  <p>“They transported his body by car,” she says firmly. “There are security cameras on the base, but suddenly they just ‘happened to be broken.' That’s what the investigator told me — that the cameras weren’t working. But honestly, I'm sure there were no cameras running at all. Everyone on the base knew what had happened. The higher-ups knew. They all knew. They were just figuring out what to do. And they decided to move his body and stage a suicide.”</p>
  <h4>The view from the ground in Ukraine</h4><ul><li><a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/27/please-don-t-use-my-name""><b>‘Please don’t use my name’</b> A report by journalist Shura Burtin on the growing war weariness among Ukrainians</a></li></ul>
  <p>Anastasia also says that Kirill's body appeared far too clean for someone who had supposedly walked 10 kilometers (six miles) through heavy rain. “I later saw the photos the officers took at the scene,” Anastasia says. “His clothes were spotless, like they’d been freshly washed. It rained heavily that night. If he had really walked all that way, he would have been covered in mud.”</p>
  <p>According to Anastasia, hazing was rampant in Kirill’s former unit. She claims that in the spring of 2024, no fewer than 11 cases of large-scale extortion were under investigation there. Allegedly, the victims were mostly soldiers returning from combat zone in Ukraine — contract soldiers and mobilized men with injuries who had received significant payouts. Other soldiers beat them and forced them to transfer money from their bank accounts, she says.</p>
  <p>People of Baikal was unable to independently verify these claims.</p>
  <h3>‘They tried to break him, but they went too far’</h3>
  <p>Kirill was buried on June 29, 2024 — the same day he was supposed to take his military oath and celebrate with his family. For the funeral, the family rented a special event space. It was there that Kirill’s mother noticed her son’s broken lips and smashed teeth.</p>
  <p>Immediately after the funeral, Anastasia recorded a video asking for help and posted it on social media. In response, several petitions demanding an investigation into Kirill’s death began circulating online, each gathering over a thousand signatures. Only after that was a criminal case opened — officially to investigate “incitement to suicide.”</p>
  <p>“If I hadn’t done anything, nothing would have happened. The investigators immediately said it was a suicide and weren’t planning to look into it,” Anastasia says.</p>
  <h4>A Russian soldier killed by his own unit</h4><ul><li><a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/04/10/ilya-bakharev-thought-joining-the-russian-army-would-be-a-ticket-to-exoneration-then-he-was-tortured-to-death-by-his-unit-mates""><b>‘He had no chance’</b> Ilya Bakharev thought joining the Russian army would be a ticket to exoneration. His unit mates tortured him to death.</a></li></ul>
  <p>The authorities opened a criminal case over his death on July 19, 2024. By July 25, Anastasia had already pushed through an exhumation and an independent forensic examination. Specialists from Russia’s Self-Regulatory Organization of Forensic Experts found serious issues with the original autopsy and said that its results did not allow for any clear conclusions about the cause of death. “It’s possible that signs of resistance or unconsciousness were present,” the report states, “which could suggest either a body being hanged after death or death by strangulation with someone holding the legs.”</p>
  <p>The experts also pointed out that the official autopsy selectively and inaccurately described the strangulation marks around Kirill’s neck. Deeming the examination of possible signs of strangulation incomplete, they noted that critical signs typically seen in hangings were simply missing. Namely, there was no feces, urine, saliva, or blood in the mouth — all of which would usually be present if someone had died by hanging.</p>
  <p>The experts concluded that the official autopsy shouldn't be used in court: it lacked a full analysis of the findings and the available evidence did not support its conclusions. In short, the military pathologists’ report could not prove that Kirill Poluyanov had died by suicide.</p>
  <p>Kirill was buried for a second time on September 11, 2024. Three months later, the criminal investigation into the alleged “incitement to suicide” was closed due to “lack of evidence.” Anastasia says she was never even officially notified. Now, investigators are only pursuing extortion charges against one of Kirill’s fellow soldiers, Alexey Sidorov. His trial began on April 7, 2025.</p>

  <p>Sidorov was also serving mandatory military duty but had been drafted six months earlier than Kirill, giving him “seniority” according to the army’s unwritten rules. According to investigators, sometime between June 23 and June 26, 2024, Sidorov demanded 500 rubles ($6) and the smartphone with Internet access that Ksenia had given to Kirill. By that time, according to Anastasia, Kirill had permission to use a touchscreen phone, as he was working as a clerk in the medical unit.</p>
  <p>Another of Kirill’s fellow soldiers, Dmitry Markelov, corroborated the extortion, telling Anastasia: ""I saw with my own eyes how they abused him."" According to Markelov, Sidorov and another soldier name Cherkashin ""would humiliate Kirill, beat him up, and extort money."" ""It happened all the time,"" he added.</p>
  <p>Anastasia believes that multiple soldiers were involved her son’s death. “There were four or five of them who killed him,” she says. “I know this because people told me that that night, he fought with two of them and gave them a good beating. So they called for backup. Kirill was strong, physically fit. He was a real man — he wouldn’t bow down to them. They tried to break him, but they went too far.”</p>
  <p>When asked what keeps her going after her son’s death, Anastasia says, “I still hope for a miracle.” Then she adds, “The real miracle will be when everyone responsible is punished — not just for the extortion, but for the murder, too.”</p>

172,Meduza EN,A failing recruitment drive. Fewer than 500 volunteers have enlisted with Ukraine’s military under a new program meant to recruit men too young for the draft,https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/04/25/a-failing-recruitment-drive,2025-04-25 19:22:25,"<figure><img src=""https://meduza.io/image/attachments/images/011/274/237/small/B-hROmfnzOT8165wMnbeIQ"" /><figcaption>Young contract soldiers in Ukraine’s 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, outside Kyiv on April 5, 2025.</figcaption></figure>
  <p>In February 2025, the Ukrainian authorities launched a campaign to recruit volunteers for contract military service. Ukrainians between the ages of 18 and 24 can enlist for a single year in exchange for a one-time payment of 1 million hryvnias (about $24,000), an interest-free housing loan, and a monthly salary of up to 120,000 hryvnias (about $2,900) — 5.5 times more than the average pay in Ukraine. Volunteers would also be exempt from Ukraine’s draft for one year after completing their service contracts. When Defense Minister Rustem Umerov <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/rustemumerov.ua/videos/1779420376213863"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">announced</a> the launch of the new campaign, he said Ukraine is “creating a new army staffing system that meets the challenges of our time.” Two months later, however, fewer than 500 people have signed contracts with the Ukrainian military under the new program. Meduza reviews the recruitment campaign’s disappointing results, focusing on a recent <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cash-bonus-year-fighting-russia-inside-ukraines-youth-recruitment-drive-2025-04-25/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">investigation</a> by Reuters.</p>
  <p>“I wish the number were higher,” Pavlo Palisa, a senior official in President Zelensky’s administration, <a href=""https://www.unian.net/society/kontrakt-18-24-palisa-skazal-skolko-soglasheniy-uzhe-podpisano-12975255.html#goog_rewarded"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">lamented</a> in an <a href=""https://youtu.be/9RAbUbYZXXU"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> on April 12, 2025. He added that roughly 1,500 volunteers are currently in the process of signing contracts with the military under the new campaign, but many applicants have not yet reached this stage. “We’re studying and definitely looking into the reasons why someone may have verbally agreed but didn’t go through with signing,” Palisa said, noting that parents often influence a young person’s decision to enlist with the armed forces. “There are various reasons, and we’re analyzing these issues to draw conclusions and, where necessary, make adjustments,” he explained.</p>

  <p>Reuters journalists <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cash-bonus-year-fighting-russia-inside-ukraines-youth-recruitment-drive-2025-04-25/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">spoke</a> with young Ukrainians who signed one-year contracts and were undergoing training before heading to the front. Pavlo Broshkov, 20, said he decided to enlist because he sees military service as his duty and wants to help protect his six-month-old daughter Polina from the horrors he himself experienced growing up during the conflict. “I don’t want my child to even hear the word ‘war’ in the future. I simply don’t want her to know what it means,” he said.</p>
  <p>Broshkov also admitted that financial incentives played a significant role in his enlistment; as a young father, he wants to provide a home for his family.</p>
  <p>While her husband serves under contract, 18-year-old Kristina Broshkova has moved back in with her parents. She says she understands the need to defend the country, but she can’t stop worrying about the danger Pavlo faces. “My husband is running from death now, and it could catch up to him at any moment,” Kristina said. “Money is a motivation, but dying for money isn’t really worth it.”</p>
  <p>Serhii Filimonov, commander of the Da Vinci Wolves battalion serving on the eastern Pokrovsk front, told Reuters that the financial rewards offered to young people under contract aren’t enough to fight a war: “You have to fight for your friends, for your family, for the future, not for a million hryvnias.” Filimonov reasoned that the young people who were truly motivated to fight had already enlisted before the military rolled out its new recruitment program. </p>
  <p>Oleksandr Moroz, a military instructor at one of the 10 brigades now signing up volunteers for one-year contracts, admitted to Reuters that most of the new recruits enlist primarily because of the financial incentives. “At this stage, they are still children, big children,” he said, describing the results of the campaign as “a drop in the ocean” in Ukraine’s broader effort to lower the average age of its front-line soldiers. Today, the average age of Ukrainian soldiers in combat is 45, a senior diplomat source with knowledge of the country's defense capabilities told Reuters. </p>
  <p>Of course, volunteers signing Ukraine’s one-year contracts list reasons beyond the financial perks. Soldiers now in training who spoke to Reuters talked about wanting to defend their homeland, some said it’s better to volunteer than be drafted, and others described ambitions to build a career in the military.</p>
  <p>However, the recruits interviewed by Reuters admitted that they weren’t fully prepared for what awaited them in uniform. “It’s like TikTok and real life: there is a big difference. In the video, it looks so cool, so easy, but in reality, it’s not,” said Zakhariy Shatko, 24, who enlisted alongside his friend, Broshkov.</p>
  <h3><strong>Analysis by Meduza columnist Dmitry Kuznets</strong></h3>
  <p>On a recent episode of Meduza’s daily podcast, Kuznets <a href=""https://meduza.io/episodes/2025/04/24/ssha-postavili-ukraine-ultimatum-peremirie-ili-amerika-perestaet-pomogat-kakie-varianty-ostayutsya-u-zelenskogo-obsuzhdaem-s-dmitriem-kuznetsom"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">concluded</a> that the Ukrainian army’s campaign to enlist young volunteers has failed if the figures Pavlo Palisa provided to Reuters are accurate.</p>
  <p>Even if Ukraine suddenly lowered its draft age and began mobilizing young men by force (as former U.S. President Joe Biden urged), it still wouldn’t solve the military's problems. The key reason is that men between 18 and 25 comprise Ukraine’s smallest age demographic, and a large portion of these people are students who are eligible for draft deferments. Additionally, external pressure on Kyiv to draft young people has likely diminished since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, and domestic politics make it unlikely that Volodymyr Zelensky would resort to mobilizing Ukraine’s youngest adult men by force.</p>

  <p>Ukraine’s central demand is that occupied Crimea cannot officially be recognized as Russian territory. “…Ukraine hopes to effectively strip out any formal international recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea or other occupied territories,” The Telegraph writes.</p>
  <p>“Points one and two focus on framing any peace deal as ‘rooted in international law, not capitulation’, with a specific warning over China’s possible invasion of Taiwan,” the article continues.</p>
  <p>The document Ukraine gave to the U.S. also stresses the need for firm security guarantees as part of any peace agreement that would have Ukraine cede territory to Russia, even temporarily.</p>
  <p>The third point, according to The Telegraph, states that Ukraine must be brought back to “the heart of the peace process.” The fourth warns the U.S. and NATO that as long as Russia retains control of Crimea, it will be able to threaten not only Ukraine but also other Black Sea nations — Turkey, Romania, and Bulgaria.</p>
  <p>The fifth point argues that any peace deal must not allow Russia to limit the size of Ukraine’s armed forces or its defense industry.</p>
  <p>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the paper that the talks are “at an intense stage” and that he hopes a long-term ceasefire could be announced by summer.</p>

Krasnodar region, Russia. December 3, 2024.</figcaption></figure>
  <p>In Krasnodar, Russia, around one hundred soldiers detained on suspicion of desertion staged a riot in a bold escape attempt last week. Seven managed to break free — four were quickly recaptured, and three remain at large. RFE/RL’s <a href=""https://www.kavkazr.com/a/vzbesivshayasya-myasorubka-bunt-voennyh-v-krasnodarskoy-komendature/33392553.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kavkaz.Realii</a> looked into what sparked this mass attempt to flee and what it reveals about how the Russian army treats deserters. Meduza shares an abridged translation of the outlet’s reporting.</p>
  <p>On the night of April 18-19, around 100 soldiers accused of desertion broke through a perimeter fence at the Krasnodar garrison commandant’s office in an attempt to escape. Police quickly placed the area under heightened security, blocking traffic and conducting vehicle searches.</p>
  <p>Seven soldiers managed to escape, according to the Telegram channel Baza. Four were captured shortly afterward, while the remaining three are still at large.</p>
  <p>Almost immediately after news of the escape attempt broke, activists from the Kuban Anti-War Committee said that law enforcement had been contacting local Telegram channel administrators, asking them to “keep quiet.” Official bodies, including the Defense Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and local authorities, haven’t commented on the situation. The Russian propaganda outlet RT reported that police were “looking into things.”</p>
  <p>The escape attempt was driven by conditions of detention, according to the wife of one soldier held there and a lawyer representing two others. They told the Telegram channel Astra that dozens of soldiers had been living in tents for months, including during the winter. “They’re all drinking there; my husband was beaten three weeks ago, he was covered in bruises. I demanded that the injuries be documented [but there was] no investigation,” one source told Astra. “Some of those being held are category D [unfit for military service], some are missing an eye, some are missing limbs.”</p>
  <p>A lawyer who spoke to Astra on condition of anonymity confirmed that some detainees had been held in the camp for more six months. “They live in tents outside. They’re given food. There’s an outdoor toilet, a shower. They’re behind a wire fence. They don’t leave the area, there’s morning [and] evening roll call. That’s it. More than a hundred people, and they do nothing,” the lawyer said.</p>
  <p>The Kuban Anti-War Committee confirmed to Kavkaz.Realii that they had previously received reports about the deserters being held in Krasnodar, but their exact location was previously unknown. The Committee also highlighted that forced returns to the front lines, including through detention, have become widespread in the region.</p>
  <h4>No exit</h4><ul><li><a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/10/30/how-getting-out-of-the-russian-army-became-all-but-impossible-even-for-soldiers-severely-disabled-in-combat""><b>How getting out of the Russian army became all but impossible — even for soldiers severely disabled in combat</b> </a></li></ul>
  <h3>‘Designed to destroy people’</h3>
  <p>Human rights advocate Ivan Chuvilyaev of Get Lost, an organization assisting Russian deserters, believes the Krasnodar rebellion is not an isolated incident, but part of a larger, systemic issue.</p>
  <p>According to Chuvilyaev, escape attempts like these rarely make headlines unless they turn into public incidents. However, before that point, each deserter typically faces a long chain of events: leaving the front lines, months on the run across Russia, detention, accusations of desertion, and ultimately being sent to a special detention unit for soldiers accused of desertion or abandonment of duty. In formal legal terms, such facilities don’t exist, but they’re created by the Russian command at regular army bases.</p>
  <p>“Desertion cases are handled by the military prosecutor’s office, which doesn’t have its own prisons or detention centers,” Chuvilyaev explains. “So entire military units have been designated for this purpose — like in Novosibirsk, where they closed off a floor and packed it with detainees. In Krasnodar, it seems, they’ve given over the whole base. They’re packed in like sardines, just waiting for the investigation to end.”</p>
  <p>These criminal cases, he adds, are primarily used as pressure tactics rather than real punishment. Soldiers are offered a deal: return to the front, and the case will be dismissed. If they refuse, the case drags on for months until sentencing. “The goal is to get them back to the front by any means,” Chuvilyaev says. “No one wants to send soldiers to prison — it’s just not useful.”</p>
  <p>According to Chuvilyaev, there are no legal standards governing the conditions of detention for deserters. “It’s total lawlessness,” he says. “Before the [full-scale] war, there weren’t this many deserters, and no one ever specified what to do with them. The infrastructure is full of holes, and people escape from military units, during detention or even after a court verdict.”</p>
  <p>Tightening the detention conditions is a way to try to “plug the holes,” Chuvilyaev explains. However, he believes that the repressive system itself won’t change, meaning escapes will continue as long as soldiers have any chance to get away.</p>
  <p>“If before it was chaos, where you could hide and run from the draft office, now it’s a bloody chaos, designed to destroy people,” he continues. “This is no longer the kind of chaos that helps you avoid death. On the contrary, it’s a raging meat grinder that grinds everyone up.”</p>

  <p>Sergey Krivenko, head of the human rights group Citizen. Army. Law, agrees that the Krasnodar riot is part of a larger trend in the army. Leaked Defense Ministry documents reveal that 50,000 soldiers had gone AWOL as of mid-December 2024.</p>
  <p>Though this number might seem small in comparison to the Russian army as a whole, Krivenko points out that in terms of soldiers deployed in Ukraine, it amounts to about 10 percent. (He estimates the number of active duty servicemen fighting in Ukraine at around 400,000 to 500,000.)</p>
  <p>“The trend is growing, especially since 2022, when dismissals were banned after mobilization,” he says. <a href=""https://zona.media/news/2024/12/27/500-itog"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">According to</a> Mediazona’s calculations, there were twice as many criminal cases for desertion in 2024 compared to 2023.</p>
  <p>Krivenko describes the conditions where deserters are held as “horrible.” “For [the command], these soldiers aren’t people; they’re cannon fodder to be sent back to the front,” Krivenko adds. “Violence is just a way to ensure that happens.”</p>

<p>EU officials are worried that US President Donald Trump could be on the verge of abandoning his efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict, the Financial Times has reported.</p>
<p>During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly promised to swiftly put an end to the fighting between Moscow and Kiev. However, after the first 100 days of his second term in the White House he has not been able to get the two sides to engage in direct talks with each other or agree to a full 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s reluctance to give in to key demands by the US and Ukraine and the overall <em>&ldquo;complexity of the conflict&rdquo;</em> have made Trump rethink his commitment to the peace process, the FT reported on Monday, citing unnamed Western European officials.</p>
<p>One official suggested that Trump was <em>&ldquo;setting up a situation where he gives himself excuses to walk away and leave it to Ukraine and us [EU] to fix.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney&rsquo;s Liberals are projected to form their fourth consecutive government following victory in the country&rsquo;s federal election, according to CBC Decision Desk and CTV News.</p>
<p>Carney centered his campaign on attacking US President Donald Trump over tariffs and the foreign leader&rsquo;s suggestion that&nbsp;Canada could become America&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;51st state.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to CTV, preliminary results from the snap election show the Liberals winning 89 seats in the House of Commons, while the Conservatives are projected to win 77. A total of 172 seats is required to form a majority government.</p>
<p>The elections were called after Justin Trudeau, the Liberal prime minister for nearly a decade, announced his resignation in January. Trudeau stepped down amid an internal crisis in his party, as his once-high approval ratings sank to historic lows.</p>
<p>Carney, a former financier who served as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, used tough language to rebuke Trump&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;unjustified&rdquo;</em> tariffs on Canadian goods.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;His strategy is to break us so America can own us,&rdquo;</em> Carney said at a campaign event in the weeks leading up to the election.</p>

<p>In his victory speech, Carney said he will deal with Trump in <em>&ldquo;full knowledge that we have many, many other options to build prosperity for all Canadians,&rdquo;</em> and pledged to maintain national independence.</p>
<p>In early March, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on most Canadian goods, citing concerns over trade imbalances and drug trafficking. Ottawa responded by introducing its own duties on US-made products.</p>
<p>Trump also argued that Canada would be better off as <em>&ldquo;the 51st state&rdquo;</em> of the US, provoking ire across the political spectrum in the run-up to elections.</p>
<p>Carney stated that during their phone call, he made it clear to Trump that Canada would, under no circumstances, become part of the US. <em>&ldquo;Absolutely not. Never. Move on,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Multiple media outlets argued that Trump&rsquo;s tariffs and aggressive rhetoric had helped boost the Liberals&rsquo; popularity. <em>&ldquo;We were dead and buried in December. Now, we&rsquo;re on track to form a government,&rdquo;</em> David Lametti, former Liberal Justice Minister, told CTV on Monday. <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve turned this around thanks to Mark,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>

            <p>US President Donald Trump has claimed he is now running not only his country but the whole world, and is <em>&ldquo;having a lot of fun&rdquo;</em> with his second presidential term.</p>
<p>The president made the remarks in an interview with The Atlantic, marking his first 100 days in office. Trump shared his experience with the magazine, stating he has been faring far better than early in his first presidency.</p>
<p>&rdquo;The first time, I had two things to do&mdash;run the country and survive; I had all these crooked guys,&rdquo; he stated. <em>&ldquo;And the second time, I run the country and the world.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Inquired further on the accounts of individuals close to the US administration, who told the magazine the president appears to be elated most of the time and has a <em>&ldquo;twinkle in his eye,&rdquo;</em> Trump confirmed that was the case and he greatly enjoys doing various <em>&ldquo;serious stuff.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun, considering what I do,&rdquo;</em> he said. <em>&ldquo;You know, what I do is such serious stuff.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The president was also asked about his repeated suggestions he could potentially run for office for the third time - despite not having the legal option to do so. The earlier remarks on the matter sparked fears Trump could ultimately opt to rewire the whole US electoral system to try and stay in power, while multiple high-profile Republicans dismissed such suggestions as joking on the president&rsquo;s part. The concerns have been reinforced by the emergence of &lsquo;Trump 2028&rsquo; merch on his official store.</p>
<p>Trump, however, insisted that he has had no actual plans to stay in office beyond his second term, admitting it was a rather complicated thing to do. <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not something that I&rsquo;m looking to do. And I think it would be a very hard thing to do,&rdquo;</em> Trump stated.</p>",Trump,positive

            <p>US President Donald Trump has encouraged Canadians to vote for him as the leader of their country in their federal election, reiterating his proposal to have America&rsquo;s northern neighbor become the 51st state of the USA.</p>
<p>In a message on his Truth Social platform on Monday, Trump wished <em>&ldquo;good luck to the great people of Canada&rdquo;</em> as they went to the polls.</p>
<p>However, his message quickly turned controversial when he suggested that Canadians should <em>&ldquo;elect the man who has the strength and wisdom&rdquo;</em> to cut taxes in half and increase military power <em>&ldquo;for free&rdquo;</em> to <em>&ldquo;the highest level in the world,&rdquo;</em> apparently referring to himself.</p>
<p>Trump suggested that if Canada becomes the <em>&ldquo;cherished 51st state&rdquo;</em> of the US, it would also lead to benefits like a <em>&ldquo;quadrupling&rdquo;</em> of industries such as steel, aluminum, energy and <em>&ldquo;all other businesses&rdquo;</em> and free the country from tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Look how beautiful this land mass would be. Free access with NO BORDER. ALL POSITIVES WITH NO NEGATIVES.

<p>Leaders from both Canada&rsquo;s Liberal and Conservative party have condemned Trump&rsquo;s comments and argued that their faction would be in the best position to lead the country, particularly amid challenges posed by the Trump presidency.</p>
<p>Trump initially brought up the idea of Canada becoming a US state in December 2024, arguing that Washington already subsidizes its northern neighbor to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars per year and that there is currently a massive bilateral trade imbalance between the two countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ottawa has vehemently rejected Trump&rsquo;s proposal, both under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his successor Mark Carney, who has stressed that Canada will <em>&ldquo;never, ever, in any way, shape, or form, be part of the United States.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Carney was elected leader of Canada&rsquo;s ruling Liberal Party last month after Trudeau resigned in January due to low approval ratings amid an ongoing housing crisis, soaring inflation rates and economic struggles.</p>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s election is set to decide if the Liberal Party maintains its nearly decade-long rule or if it will be replaced by Pierre Poilievre&rsquo;s Conservative Party. Recent polls have suggested a tight race, with neither side expected to win an outright majority, which would result in a minority government.</p>",Trump,positive

            <p>British troops would help <em>&ldquo;rebuild&rdquo;</em> the Ukrainian armed forces under a potential deployment to the country following a ceasefire with Russia, UK Defense Secretary John Healey has said, according to The Telegraph.</p>
<p>The UK and France have led discussions in recent weeks among several European NATO member states about sending military personnel to Ukraine as part of a so-called <em>&ldquo;coalition of the willing,&rdquo;</em> once Kiev and Moscow have agreed a ceasefire. Russia has strongly objected to Western troops being deployed to Ukraine under any pretext.</p>
<p>In an article on Sunday, The Telegraph cited a letter reportedly sent last week by Healey to Shadow Defense Secretary James Cartlidge. In it, the British defense chief is said to have written that <em>&ldquo;we expect those objectives to focus on rebuilding a modern and capable armed forces of Ukraine, rather than delivering combat operations.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to the newspaper, Healey defined the potential British contingent&rsquo;s goal as helping Kiev <em>&ldquo;regenerate an armed forces capable of deterring future Russian aggression.&rdquo;</em> UK military personnel would likely be stationed in Western Ukraine, away from the front line, The Telegraph claimed.</p>
<p>In addition, the British Royal Air Force and Navy would reportedly be on standby to cover Ukraine&rsquo;s air space and territorial waters, if necessary.</p>

            <p>Americans are increasingly reliant on buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to purchase their groceries, a survey conducted by online lending marketplace Lending Tree indicates. The trend is bound to continue and the situation is unlikely to improve in the near term, the marketplace&rsquo;s analysts warn, citing inflation, high interest rates and growing concerns around tariffs.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by the platform early in April among some 2,000 American consumers aged 18 to 70, with around a half of them reporting they have been using the BNPL services.</p>
<p>The short-term loans scheme has become increasingly popular over the past few years, as it allows to split up purchases into smaller payments, its providers often do not charge interest, while credit score is not taken into account. Paying late or stacking up multiple loans, however, could result in high fees.</p>
<p>Some 41% of BNPL users admitted missing payments, with the figure growing from 34% recorded by the marketplace last year. Nearly a quarter of BNPL users said they had three more active loans at a time. At the same time, a vast majority of BNPL users - some 62% - falsely believe the loans of the type help their credit score, while a further 26% were not sure on the matter, the survey indicated.</p>

<p>The poll suggested a nearly twofold growth of BNPL use to fund groceries, with 25% of the scheme users paying for their foodstuffs through it compared to only 14% last year.

<p>The BNPL use is bound to grow and the trend observed in the survey is unlikely to change in the short term at least, Lending Tree&rsquo;s chief consumer finance analyst, Matt Schulz, has said. The analyst cautioned against overusing BNPL loans, describing it a <em>&ldquo;really good interest-free tool,&rdquo;</em> but warning of <em>&ldquo;a lot of risk in mismanaging it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Inflation is still a problem. Interest rates are still really high. There&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs and other economic issues, and it&rsquo;s all going to add up to a lot of people looking for ways to extend their budget however they can,&rdquo;</em> he said, warning the situation with the loans is likely <em>&ldquo;to get worse.&rdquo;</em></p>",Trump,positive

<p>The WSJ stressed that civil servants had also been graded previously, but it was done based on factors such as business acumen, leadership skills, ability to build coalitions and results of their work.</p>
<p>During the previous Democratic administration of President Joe Biden, staffing policy focused heavily on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices. Critics, however, argued that DEI initiatives often prioritized identity over merit, leading to claims of lowered standards and divisiveness.

<p>Shortly after assuming office in January, Trump signed several executive orders aimed at eliminating DEI initiatives, describing them as <em>&ldquo;radical,&rdquo;</em> within the federal government, its contractors, and grantees.</p>
<p>The WSJ said that OPM had already begun approving positions that other federal agencies are looking to add in what it described as an attempt by the Trump administration <em>&ldquo;to consolidate control over the hiring and firing of federal workers.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management will also continue some of the government downsizing efforts initiated by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, according to the report.

            <p><strong></strong>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has announced a new national doctrine that seeks to turn Warsaw into an <em>&ldquo;economic miracle&rdquo;</em> protected by the <em>&ldquo;strongest army in the region,&rdquo;</em> in a speech marking the 1,000th anniversary of the creation of the Kingdom of Poland.</p>
<p>Speaking on Friday in Gniezno, the city where the first King of Poland, Boleslaw the Brave, was crowned a millennium ago, Tusk outlined the three <em>&ldquo;pillars&rdquo;</em> of&nbsp;the National Piast Doctrine, named after the country's first historical ruling house.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We will have the strongest army in the region. Don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s impossible. Yes, our army must be able to overcome any threat. From the east, west, south &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo;</em> Tusk said of the first pillar in his <a href=""https://www.gov.pl/web/premier/narodowa-doktryna-piastowska"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">address</a>. He promised to <em>&ldquo;take advantage of this tragic, dramatic experience of this war that is going on beyond our borders.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The second pillar of the doctrine&nbsp;is to build <em>&ldquo;the strongest economy in the region.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Poland is strengthening its position among the absolute leaders of economic growth in Europe,&rdquo;</em> Tusk said. <em>&ldquo;Today we are really one step away from the fact that not only in Europe but all over the world people will say with admiration: &lsquo;Oh, Poland, this is an economic miracle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Political influence in the EU and globally forms the third pillar of the doctrine, Tusk said, stressing the importance of maintaining strong ties with Warsaw&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;most important ally,&rdquo;</em> Washington.</p>
<p>Polish President Andrzej Duda reportedly even urged Washington to move part of its nuclear arsenal stored in Western Europe or the United States to Poland. US Vice President J.D. Vance said he would be <em>&ldquo;shocked&rdquo;</em> if President Donald Trump ever supported such an idea.</p>

<p>Poland has been among Ukraine&rsquo;s main supporters since the escalation of the conflict with Russia in 2022, providing more than &euro;5.1 billion ($5.7 billion) in aid, over 70% of which was military, according to Germany&rsquo;s Kiel Institute. The country has also taken in a large number of refugees from its neighbor, although public attitudes have reportedly cooled amid the influx of arrivals.</p>
<p>Warsaw will&nbsp;<em>&rdquo;</em>brutally&rdquo;&nbsp;protect its economic interests and intends to profit from future aid to Ukraine, including from post-conflict reconstruction, Tusk said earlier this month.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;American ships, both military and commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the Panama and Suez Canals! Those canals would not exist without the United States of America,&rdquo;</em> the president said in a Truth Social post.</p>

<p>While the&nbsp;Suez Canal was conceived, financed and built in the 1850s by the British and French, Egypt has received more than $87bn in foreign aid from Washington since 1946, <a href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/12/egypt-jordan-and-the-us-aid-game"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">according to Al Jazeera</a>, making the country&nbsp;one of the highest recipients in the Middle East after Israel.</p>
<p>The United States and the Soviet Union played key roles in pressuring Britain, France, and Israel to withdraw troops from Egypt during the 1956-1957 Suez Crisis, thereby helping to restore Egyptian control over the canal.</p>
<p>Later, after Israel had invaded and occupied the Sinai Peninsula in 1967 and shut down the canal for eight years, the US&nbsp;brokered a peace deal&nbsp;which restored full control to Egypt in 1982.</p>
<p>The US not only constructed the Panama Canal, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, in the early 20th century, but was also instrumental in securing Panamanian&nbsp;independence from neighboring Colombia.</p>
<p>Full control of the canal was transferred to Panama in 1999 under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which stipulated that it would remain neutral and open to all nations.</p>
<p>Trump and US officials have argued that China&rsquo;s economic activities &ndash; including infrastructure projects and port operations &ndash; may violate the 1977 Panama Canal Neutrality Treaty, which grants the US the right to <em>&ldquo;defend&rdquo;</em> the waterway.</p>

<p>A preliminary Memorandum of Intent was signed last week, according to Ukraine&rsquo;s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Sviridenko. Trump, however, has complained that the process is dragging on too long.</p>

<p>The deal was expected to be signed in February during a visit by Zelensky visit to the White House.

<p>Last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said White House officials were <em>&ldquo;still working on the details&rdquo;</em> of when and where the signing would take place, but expected that negotiations would be completed by April 26. The Memorandum of Intent also outlines this timeline.</p>
<p>In his post on Friday, Trump also commented on Ukraine peace efforts, saying <em>&ldquo;work on the overall Peace Deal between Russia and Ukraine is going smoothly&rdquo;</em> and that <em>&ldquo;success seems to be in the future.&rdquo;</em> In another post, he indicated plans to meet with Russian and Ukrainian representatives on Saturday in Rome, where he is attending Pope Francis&rsquo; funeral, which Zelensky also plans to attend.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to finish it off. Most of the major points are agreed to,&rdquo;</em> Trump wrote.</p>

            <p>Apple plans to move the assembly of all US-bound iPhones from China to India in light of the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, the Financial Times has reported.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on numerous countries, with Chinese goods facing duties as high as 145%. He has argued that the measures will help revive domestic manufacturing and redress the skewed trade balance. Beijing responded by imposing its own tariffs and export restrictions.</p>
<p>The US Customs and Border Protection agency went on to publish a list of exempted articles, which are subject only to a separate 20% rate and include computers, laptops, smartphones and other tech devices and components. Commenting on the decision, the White House stated that the exemptions are meant to give companies enough time to localize their production on US soil.</p>
<p>On Friday, the FT reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that Apple hopes to complete the shift of its assembly lines to India by the end of 2026, affecting more than 60 million iPhones sold annually in the US.</p>

<p>According to the publication, the tech giant has had to speed up its pre-existing diversification strategy amid the intensifying trade war, and now aims to double the iPhone output in India.</p>
<p>While the company has already moved some of its assembly lines to India and Vietnam, China still remains the leading production center for iPhones globally. Apple has invested heavily there over almost two decades.</p>
<p>A lot of the constituent components that are put together during assembly are sourced from China, the FT noted.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Times of India, citing unnamed senior officials, alleged that Apple had transported five planeloads of iPhones and other devices from India to the US within a span of three days in late March. The shipment was reportedly conducted in anticipation of a 10% reciprocal tariff on Indian goods introduced by Trump, which took effect on April 5.</p>
<p>The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the US at $799 last September. This could now rise by 43% to $1,142 should Apple pass the burden on to consumers, Reuters estimated, citing calculations based on projections from analysts at Rosenblatt Securities.</p>",Trump,negative

If they align just right, all can benefit</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The current phase of relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States marks a notable convergence: the return of a moderate tendency to power in Iran coincides with Donald Trump&rsquo;s leadership in the US, representing a revitalized faction within the Republican Party.</p>
<p>However, the nuclear issue, once briefly regarded as the sole resolved point of contention between the two nations, has resurfaced as the foremost challenge since Trump&rsquo;s unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018. While a readily available pretext for political friction, this matter is not inherently alarming given its two-decade history; yet, it remains the linchpin of tensions between Iran and the United States.</p>
<p>A critical starting point for analyzing the challenges in Iran-US relations lies in assessing the positions and interests of key stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Arab states of the region have adopted a markedly softer and more amicable stance toward Iran compared to the periods of JCPOA negotiations, its signing, and the subsequent US withdrawal. Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain &ndash; previously strained for reasons not entirely clear &ndash; have evolved into a state of cautious friendliness, if not outright warmth. Given the geographic proximity of these nations to Iran, their deep ties with the United States, Europe, China, and Russia, and their collective influence, this shift carries significant implications for the policies of major powers concerning Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program.</p>
<p>Israel, by contrast, has consistently viewed any improvement in Iran&rsquo;s relations with the West, particularly the US, as a strategic red line. Throughout the JCPOA negotiations, its implementation under the Obama administration, and Trump&rsquo;s first term, Israel exerted maximum effort to undermine any proposed resolution to disputes involving Iran and the US, Europe, or even Arab states. For Israel, the substance of the issue is at most secondary or even nonsense; its utility lies in its potential to securitize Iran, isolating and pressuring it &ndash; a goal Tel Aviv* deems sufficiently met as long as this dynamic persists.</p>

<p>The EU, despite being a large and diverse union of over 20 member states, largely follows the lead of France, Germany, and the UK in foreign policy, two of which hold permanent seats on the UN Security Council. While these nations outwardly advocate for diplomatic solutions, their stance toward Iran has hardened considerably since the 2013-2018 period. Moreover, their exclusive control over the JCPOA&rsquo;s dispute resolution mechanism &ndash; known as the <em>&ldquo;snapback&rdquo;</em> &ndash; combined with transatlantic divergences, has imbued the issue with an identity-driven, Atlantic-spanning dimension. Consequently, while Western Europe is unlikely to spearhead bold diplomatic initiatives, it retains the capacity to disrupt progress, particularly through the snapback mechanism, motivated in part by these identity-based considerations.</p>
<p>Russia emerges as another pivotal actor. As one of Iran&rsquo;s most significant partners, having stood by Tehran during sanctions, Russia holds a prominent role in Iran&rsquo;s foreseeable future, including in negotiations and their aftermath. Compared to the JCPOA negotiation period, Iran-Russia relations have matured, while Moscow&rsquo;s ties with Washington have entered uncharted territory, shaped by the Ukraine war, Trump&rsquo;s eagerness to resolve it, personal rapport between the two leaders, and tensions largely stoked by Washington&rsquo;s European allies. However, historically, Russia neither favors an escalation of Iran-West tensions nor benefits from their complete reconciliation. This duality suggests that Tehran&rsquo;s policymakers should approach Moscow strategically, ensuring Russia perceives tangible benefits in supporting improved Iran-West relations &ndash; a prospect that is far from guaranteed and requires deliberate design.</p>
<p>China, among all actors surrounding Iran&rsquo;s nuclear issue and broader disputes with the West, stands as perhaps the most distant yet consistent in its declared positions. Beijing profits from sanctions on Iran &ndash; albeit indirectly &ndash; while also standing to gain from their removal, which would open a relatively untapped market to Chinese investors and contractors. Like Russia, China seeks to prevent heightened Iran-West tensions but does not necessarily welcome excessive rapprochement, which could intensify competition in Iran&rsquo;s market. For Iran to elevate China&rsquo;s role from political support to economic and operational engagement, it must astutely align any prospective agreement with Beijing&rsquo;s interests.</p>

<p>Regional actors, such as Iran&rsquo;s allies in West Asia &ndash; including resistance groups that are not mere proxies but longstanding anti-occupation movements &ndash; have never opposed a resolution of Iran&rsquo;s disputes with the West. With the Axis of Resistance having endured military setbacks over the past year, one of the West&rsquo;s &ndash; and particularly Israel&rsquo;s &ndash; primary pretexts for challenging Iran&rsquo;s regional role has effectively dissipated.</p>
<p>Before starting the recent negotiations, both Iran and the US employed a carrot-and-stick approach, blending diplomatic overtures with veiled threats. Yet, clinging to outdated policies will not yield innovative solutions in global politics. Western actors, in particular, must acknowledge that Iranian policymakers, seasoned by over four decades of managing a nation under pressure, advancing its development, and navigating critical regional and international crises, are unlikely to be cowed by familiar threats into a weaker negotiating position. Such tactics may instead erode the credibility of the West &ndash; and the Trump administration specifically &ndash; in pursuing a balanced diplomatic resolution.</p>
<p>This analysis proposes the following actionable recommendations to ensure enough pragmatism and fruitful talks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US must unify its internal stance, ensuring that disparate voices do not undermine painstakingly built progress.</li>
<li>Both sides should abandon traditional threat-based posturing to bolster negotiating leverage, instead emphasizing transparent commitment to peaceful, diplomatic solutions.</li>
<li>Trump must curb Israel&rsquo;s potential to derail an initiative he champions, leveraging his influence as its key backer.</li>
<li>The US should align its European allies to prevent their statements or actions from obstructing resolution efforts.</li>
<li>Iran should engage Russia, China, and Europe to minimize unnecessary friction and secure meaningful cooperation.</li>
<li>Regional Arab states should be enlisted to de-escalate tensions and foster a <em>&ldquo;strong region&rdquo;</em> paradigm, moving beyond the <em>&ldquo;strong state&rdquo;</em> focus.</li>
<li>The International Atomic Energy Agency&rsquo;s positive capacity should be utilized to compartmentalize issues, preventing extraneous matters from derailing potential outcomes.</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps, if pursued with strategic foresight, could pave the way for a sustainable resolution to a decades-long impasse.</p>

<p>Speaking to Time Magazine to commemorate the first 100 days of his second term in office, Trump gave an extensive interview covering key topics such as immigration, tariffs, and the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a recap of what Trump said.</p>
<aside class=""listicle"">
<p><strong>Kiev&rsquo;s NATO aspirations</strong></p>
<p>Trump stated that Ukraine&rsquo;s desire to join NATO was one of the key reasons for the escalation of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev in 2022, and stressed that the topic should never have been raised. He emphasized that Ukraine is unlikely to ever actually join the bloc.</p>
<p>His comments echo Moscow&rsquo;s repeated statements that NATO membership for Kiev would represent a national security threat to Russia, and that its ambitions to join the military bloc were among the root causes of the current conflict.</p>

<p><strong>Russia&rsquo;s Crimea</strong></p>
<p>Trump stated that Crimea <em>&ldquo;will stay with Russia&rdquo;</em> under a final peace deal on the Ukraine conflict, noting that the peninsula <em>&ldquo;went to the Russians&rdquo;</em> many years ago and that <em>&ldquo;everyone,&rdquo;</em> including Vladimir Zelensky, understands that its status is unlikely to change.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Trump suggested that he was making good progress on reaching a deal and that there have been <em>&ldquo;very good talks&rdquo;</em> with the Russian side. <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting very close to a deal,&rdquo;</em> Trump said, expressing hope that the US could do business with both Russia and Ukraine once a settlement is reached.</p>

<p>Trump confirmed that he has begun direct talks with Iran and that he is open to a meeting with the country&rsquo;s president or supreme leader in order to reach a deal on Tehran&rsquo;s nuclear program.</p>
<p>At the same time, Trump suggested that while he would not be <em>&ldquo;dragged&rdquo;</em> into a conflict with Iran if Israel chooses to attack it, Washington could still <em>&ldquo;go in very willingly&rdquo;</em> if a deal is not reached.</p>
<p>The president also touched on his upcoming trip to the Middle East to meet with representatives of Saudi Arabia, who have agreed to invest $1 trillion in the US economy, as well as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Washington tabled a proposed deal to end hostilities between Kiev and Moscow during a meeting in Paris on Thursday last week. A follow-up meeting took place in London on Wednesday, at which Ukrainian officials and their NATO European counterparts drafted counterproposal.</p>
<p>The London talks were downgraded at the last minute after Ukraine&rsquo;s Vladimir Zelensky publicly rejected key American suggestions. He declared on Thursday that the European-backed <em>&ldquo;strategy&rdquo;</em> was now <em>&ldquo;on President Trump&rsquo;s table.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Having examined the drafts <em>&ldquo;in full and explicit detail&rdquo;</em> on Friday, Reuters identified four critical areas of disagreement.</p>

<p>The US document offers a <em>&ldquo;robust security guarantee&rdquo;</em> for Ukraine from willing nations, according to Reuters. The Euro-proposal rival proposal insists that no restrictions be placed on Ukraine&rsquo;s military, including the deployment of foreign troops on its territory, and calls for the US to provide NATO-like protection to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia demands Ukraine remains neutral and insists that it will not accept any NATO troop presence, or troops from bloc members as part of a coalition, in the country.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that the US is advocating for the removal of restrictions imposed on Russia since 2014, while Kiev and the Europeans propose a <em>&ldquo;gradual easing of sanctions after a sustainable peace is achieved,&rdquo;</em> paired with a threat of snapback measures for non-compliance.</p>
<p>The US framework includes mentions of financial compensation for Ukraine, but lacks specifics. The Kiev-backed counterproposal identifies frozen Russian assets in Western countries as a source for such payments, according to Reuters. Russia has labeled the seizure of its funds illegal and views any use of these assets to support Ukraine as <em>&ldquo;theft.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Since returning to office in January, Trump has been pressuring both Moscow and Kiev to settle the conflict.

            <p>Germany continues to store spare pipes for the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which was rendered inoperable by sabotage in September 2022, Ostsee Zeitung has reported. The stockpile is reportedly large enough to fully repair the damaged sections.</p>
<p>Three of the four pipelines were fractured in underwater explosions that caused severe leaks in September 2022, just months after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict. The pipelines were shut down, and the Nord Stream 2 gas receiving station in the German port city of Lubmin was mothballed. No perpetrators have been officially named, though investigations continue, and some reports have pointed to Kiev.</p>
<p>According to the outlet, around 1,000 replacement pipes worth &euro;25 million ($28 million) remain stored in two warehouses near Lubmin.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The material has a high value,&rdquo;</em> a source familiar with the situation said. <em>&ldquo;Such a quantity of pipes should be approximately enough to repair the destroyed sections,&rdquo;</em> they added.</p>

            

    

<p></p>
<p>Another source said the underwater repairs would be <em>&ldquo;relatively easy in the technical sense&rdquo;</em> and fast, assuming the materials don&rsquo;t require new production.</p>
<p>Hans-Peter Huber, a lawyer for pipeline operator Nord Stream 2 AG, a subsidiary of Russia&rsquo;s Gazprom, confirmed that the pipes remain in Lubmin and belong to the operators. He said their recovery has been complicated by insolvency proceedings in Switzerland concerning the company&rsquo;s debts to minor creditors.</p>

<p>As a result of Western sanctions, around &euro;70 million in company funds held at an EU bank were frozen, blocking payments to debtors, Huber noted. The company has until May 9 to settle with creditors or face bankruptcy, which could lead to roughly 500 of the stored pipes being auctioned off. The proceedings do not affect Nord Stream 1, however, which is not in insolvency, Huber added.</p>
<p>Gazprom previously said the pipelines could be restored, though the process could take more than a year.</p>
<p>Amid signs of a thaw in US-Russia ties following President Donald Trump&rsquo;s return to office, both sides have reportedly discussed restoring Nord Stream as part of Ukraine peace talks.</p>
<p>According to Politico, Washington is <a href=""https://www.rt.com/news/616182-rubio-witkoff-politico-fake-crap/"">considering</a>&nbsp;lifting sanctions on Nord Stream and other Russian assets in Europe as part of the efforts.&nbsp;Other outlets <a href=""https://www.rt.com/news/614179-us-russia-talks-nord-stream/"">reported</a>&nbsp;a potential deal that would allow US investors to acquire a stake in Nord Stream 2 to prevent its bankruptcy.

Brandenburg's minister-president, Dietmar Woidke, slammed it as being <em>&ldquo;completely out of place,&rdquo;</em> while the state&rsquo;s economic minister, Daniel Keller, demanded that Kiziltepe retract her statement.</p>
<p>The post has since been deleted, although Kiziltepe has defended her position, stating on X on Friday that she <em>&ldquo;expressly stands&rdquo;</em> by her assessment of Musk, and linking Tesla&rsquo;s slump in sales to <em>&ldquo;the far-right positions&rdquo;</em> of its CEO.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of this year, Tesla vehicle deliveries dropped globally by 13% year-on-year, automotive revenue slumped 20% and net income plunged by 71%.</p>
<p>Tesla&rsquo;s Gigafactory near Berlin was targeted by protesters earlier this year when the word <em>&ldquo;heil&rdquo;</em> was seen projected onto its wall next to the automaker&rsquo;s logo, spelling the message <em>&ldquo;Heil Tesla.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>During a campaign ceremony marking Trump&rsquo;s inauguration in January, Musk made a gesture that his critics interpreted as a Nazi <em>&ldquo;Sieg Heil&rdquo;</em> salute. Musk dismissed the accusations as politically motivated.</p>
<p>The billionaire has previously voiced his support of Germany&rsquo;s right-wing AfD, a rival to the ruling SPD. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Musk&rsquo;s backing of the AfD <em>&ldquo;disgusting.&rdquo;</em> Economic Minister Robert Habeck also accused the entrepreneur of launching a <em>&ldquo;frontal attack&rdquo;</em> on democracy.</p>

<p>When pressed on whether Ukraine would have to cede territory to secure peace, Trump would not rule out the possibility, saying: <em>&ldquo;It depends [on] what territory. We&rsquo;ll do the best we can, but they lost a lot of territory.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>However, the US leader also insisted that his administration was <em>&ldquo;putting a lot of pressure on Russia.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>His comments came after Trump signaled he was <em>&ldquo;not happy&rdquo;</em> with the recent Russian missile and drone strikes across Ukraine, calling them <em>&ldquo;not necessary, and very bad timing.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying.

<p>Trump won the 2024 election by a wide margin against Democratic candidate and then-Vice President Kamala Harris, becoming the second president in US history to serve two non-consecutive terms.</p>
<p>The 22nd Amendment states that no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice. However, Trump allies have floated legal arguments challenging or reinterpreting the amendment&rsquo;s wording, hinting at potential legal or political strategies to pave the way for a third run.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;NATO is good as long as NATO is real, as long as it&rsquo;s a real defense alliance, not the United States and a bunch of junior partners that aren&rsquo;t doing their fair share,&rdquo;</em> the top US diplomat said. <em>&ldquo;It has to be a NATO in which your partners are carrying their weight.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>At his first meeting of NATO foreign affairs ministers earlier this month, Rubio reassured allies that US President Donald Trump is not anti-NATO and that the country will remain in the bloc, but he&rsquo;s also asking his counterparts to make sacrifices and raise defense spending to 5%.</p>

            <p>A number of European states are seeking to undermine US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s efforts to broker a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine conflict, according to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Agency (SVR).</p>
<p>Trump has pushed for a swift end to the hostilities since taking office in January. His administration has held several rounds of high-level talks with Russia in the last three months.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on Thursday, the SVR said the British and French intelligence agencies have been working to discredit Trump and derail negotiations between Washington and Moscow.</p>
<p>The two countries&rsquo; spy services have <em>&ldquo;instructed&rdquo;</em> employees of the now Russia-banned Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), founded by the late opposition figure Alexey Navalny, to dig up <em>&ldquo;informational dirt&rdquo;</em> and spread false claims about <em>&ldquo;unofficial links&rdquo;</em> between Trump&rsquo;s associates and Russia. They also approached staff from opposition investigative outlet Proekt and Latvian-based Russian-language website Meduza with the same task. Moscow has labeled FBK an <em>&ldquo;extremist&rdquo;</em> group while the two media outlets are listed as <em>&ldquo;undesirable&rdquo;</em> organizations. Their staff have fled Russia and are now <em>&ldquo;on the edge of survival,&rdquo;</em> the SVR wrote. <br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The newly minted European warmongers are launching a campaign to undermine President Donald Trump&rsquo;s peacekeeping efforts,&rdquo;</em> the SVR stated.</p>
<p>According to the agency, London and Paris are particularly interested in information on US business ventures with Russian energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft, as well as state corporations Rostec and Rosatom. The aim, it said, is to damage US policy and disrupt peace talks.</p>

            <p>Western Europe is once again returning to a familiar role: a primary source of global instability. For Russia, this presents a critical question&mdash;should we simply turn our backs on the West and focus entirely on our eastern partners? Judging by the current trend in Russian foreign trade of Asian countries steadily taking a larger share, this conclusion may appear reasonable. Yet such a strategy, while tempting, is short-sighted.</p>
<p>From antiquity to the present, Europe has often served as a destabilizing force. From the Greek island raiders who disrupted the Nile Valley civilizations, to modern Western European meddling in Africa and aggression in Ukraine, the continent has rarely chosen diplomacy over division. The dismantling of colonial empires and Western Europe&rsquo;s post-war subordination to the United States softened this tendency. But today, old habits are re-emerging.</p>
<p>European political rhetoric may sound hollow, even absurd, given the continent&rsquo;s dwindling economic and demographic weight. However, that does not make it less dangerous. Europe is no longer the heart of global politics, yet paradoxically remains its most likely flashpoint. Here, the possibility of a direct military clash between great powers remains disturbingly real.</p>
<p>For Russia, Western Europe is a historical adversary, one that has long sought to dictate terms or impose its will. From Napoleon to Hitler, and now to Brussels&rsquo; bureaucrats, attempts to subdue or marginalize Russia have been met with fierce resistance. This enduring conflict defines much of our shared history. Today, facing its own developmental dead ends, Western Europe once again turns outward in search of a scapegoat. This time, the preferred solution is militarization, supposedly to counter a <em>&ldquo;Russian threat.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The irony is obvious. The EU&rsquo;s grand vision of integration is in disarray. Its socio-economic models are faltering. Britain, now outside the bloc, is no better off. Aging populations, failing welfare systems, and uncontrolled migration are stoking nationalist sentiments and pushing elites toward more radical postures. Finland, once neutral and pragmatic, now also leans into anti-Russian rhetoric to mask its growing internal malaise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the institutions that once underpinned European unity are crumbling. The EU&rsquo;s central structures in Brussels are widely viewed with disdain. National governments resist ceding further power, and the criteria for leadership within the bloc seem to have become cynicism and incompetence. For over a decade, the top posts have gone not to visionary leaders, but to pliable figures chosen for their loyalty and lack of ambition.</p>

<p>Gone are the days of Jacques Delors or even Romano Prodi, who at least understood the value of dialogue with Russia. In their place, we have figures like Ursula von der Leyen and Kaja Kallas, whose inability to achieve anything meaningful within the bloc leads them to seek relevance by provoking confrontation with Moscow. The EU&rsquo;s turn toward Russophobia is not strategic&mdash;it is compensatory.</p>
<p>Western Europe&rsquo;s global credibility continues to erode. The reason is simple: a lack of empathy and introspection. The continent views the world through a mirror, seeing only itself. This solipsism, coupled with economic stagnation, makes it harder for its leaders to convert its shrinking economic advantages into geopolitical influence.</p>
<p>Africa offers a telling case. France&rsquo;s influence, once substantial in its former colonies, is rapidly vanishing. Local governments, tired of paternalistic lectures and ineffective policies, are turning instead to Russia, the United States, or even China to build new partnerships.</p>
<p>Even Western Europe&rsquo;s relationship with the United States is entering a phase of uncertainty. As internal divisions grow in America, European elites accustomed to strategic dependence now find themselves increasingly anxious. They are unsure whether Washington will continue to shield them, or whether they will be left to face the consequences of their own miscalculations. This insecurity partly explains the EU&rsquo;s heightened hostility toward Russia: it is a desperate bid for attention and relevance.</p>
<p>Representatives of the new US administration have already hinted at the lack of real strategic contradictions with Russia. Such statements provoke panic in Brussels. Western European elites fear a US-Russia thaw that could leave them sidelined. They know Washington will not grant them independence in foreign policy, but they also fear that its patronage will no longer come with privileges.</p>

<p>In short, Europe is again becoming a source of global risk. But should Russia simply walk away? It might seem logical, given the shift in our trade and strategic focus toward Asia. But abandoning the West entirely would be a mistake.</p>
<p>If Western Europe&rsquo;s current trajectory does not lead to a catastrophic military escalation, we will still have to engage with it. The region is our neighbor, our former partner, and our historical mirror. It is therefore essential to monitor its internal developments, anticipate its moves, and prepare for the day when real diplomacy becomes possible again.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean indulging European fantasies or tolerating aggression. But it does mean staying informed and engaged. The <em>&ldquo;sick man&rdquo;</em> of global politics may no longer be capable of leadership, but that does not make him irrelevant. And until he recovers or fades away entirely, we must keep a close watch.</p>

            <p>European NATO members must overcome their dependence on the US for security and increase their own military spending, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said.</p>
<p>The US is prioritizing the protection of its own borders <em>&ldquo;after decades of securing other people&rsquo;s borders in far-off places,&rdquo;</em> Hegseth stated on Wednesday. This shift in focus from the Pentagon comes alongside an <em>&ldquo;increased allied burden-sharing&rdquo;</em> in strategic regions, he added, as he summarized his first 100 days in office in a speech at the Army War College in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We have obtained commitments from Poland &ndash; one of many model allies &ndash; the Baltics, to spend 5% of their GDP on defense,&rdquo;</em> Hegseth reported. He emphasized that NATO&rsquo;s longstanding spending target of 2% <em>&ldquo;is not enough, considering the threats you face.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong><em>The time of the United States&hellip; being the sole guarantor of European security has passed. It&rsquo;s long overdue Europe has to step up, fund its military, and lead. NATO needs to step up.</em></strong></p>

<p>Hegseth also stated that shifting the responsibility for military assistance to Ukraine onto European countries is part of the Pentagon&rsquo;s realignment.</p>
<p>The EU plans to borrow hundreds of billions of euros to spend on militarization, asserting the need to deter Russia. Moscow denies any aggressive intentions toward NATO members.</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in a recent interview with French magazine Le Point, remarked that Europe has shot itself in the foot by following directives from former US President Joe Biden to support Ukraine <em>&ldquo;for as long as it takes&rdquo;</em> and to punish Russia with sanctions. It is now facing the <a href=""https://www.rt.com/business/616130-germany-zero-growth-forecast/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">repercussions</a> of those decisions, Peskov believes.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Europe cannot exist and be competitive without two key elements: affordable security and inexpensive energy,&rdquo;</em> he argued. <em>&ldquo;Europe used to enjoy security from the US at a low cost. And it received cheap energy from Russia.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Peskov suggested that having lost both of these advantages, European nations are now facing deindustrialization and other economic challenges while stubbornly pursuing a failed policy, even as the administration of US President Donald Trump seeks to mediate a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has also clashed with various European nations over issues such as perceived unfair trade practices and Denmark&rsquo;s management of Greenland, which the US has expressed interest in taking control of.</p>",Trump,positive

<p>The incident reportedly unfolded in the West Wing on Thursday within earshot of President Donald Trump and visiting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The two men argued over Trump&rsquo;s recent decision to name Gary Shapley, Musk&rsquo;s preferred candidate, as acting IRS commissioner &ndash; a move that blindsided Bessent, who had lobbied for his deputy, Michael Faulkender.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It was two billionaire, middle-aged men thinking it was WWE in the hall of the West Wing,&rdquo;</em> one witness told Axios on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Musk reportedly accused Bessent &ndash; a former partner at Soros Fund Management and the founder of Key Square Group &ndash; of being a <em>&ldquo;Soros agent.&rdquo;</em> Bessent <em>&ldquo;roared&rdquo;</em> back, at one point allegedly shouting <em>&ldquo;F**k you,&rdquo;</em> to which Musk replied, <em>&ldquo;Say it louder.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p>A US federal judge has issued an injunction against the decision by the administration of President Donald Trump to cut funding for Voice of America (VOA), ordering the government to restore resources to the state-funded propaganda outlet.</p>
<p>VOA and its sister service, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, have long functioned as foreign-language broadcasting arms of the United States government. The outlets were originally created during the Cold War to spread pro-Western propaganda in the Soviet bloc, with RFE/RL initially being financed by the CIA. Recently, both outlets have depended on grants from the US Congress.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Trump ordered funding to be slashed for the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the federal body that oversees VOA and RFE/RL. The move forced the outlets to put their employees on unpaid leave. The decision has been framed by the Trump administration as part of a broader effort to dismantle bureaucratic influence networks and shift toward soft power efforts in line with <em>&ldquo;America First&rdquo;</em> principles.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Judge Royce Lamberth of the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Trump&rsquo;s efforts to dismantle VOA were unlawful. The justice, appointed to the bench in 1987 by then-President Ronald Reagan, expressed concern over the abrupt defunding of the outlet, citing potential long-term harm to its employees and consumers.</p>
<p>In his ruling, Lamberth ordered the USAGM to restore funding to VOA and other outlets under its umbrella and barred the agency from blocking their operation. He further stated that Trump&rsquo;s slashing of USAGM funding was done <em>&ldquo;without regard to the harm inflicted on employees, contractors, journalists, and media consumers around the world.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Lamberth noted that his order does not apply to RFE/RL as he had previously already issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from defunding the outlet.</p>

<p>In 2017, Russia&rsquo;s Justice Ministry designated both VOA and RFE/RL as <em>&ldquo;foreign agents&rdquo;</em> and required the outlets to label their content accordingly. In early 2024, RFE/RL was further classified as an <em>&ldquo;undesirable organization,&rdquo;</em> effectively banning its operations in Russia and exposing affiliated individuals to legal consequences.</p>

214,RT English,Musk promises to cut back on White House role,https://www.rt.com/news/616140-musk-tesla-profit-doge/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS,2025-04-23 10:03:17,"<p><strong>Analysts have linked Tesla steep losses to its CEO’s role as a US government efficiency czar</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p></p>
<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has announced he will scale back his efforts to cut government spending at the controversial US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and refocus on his businesses. Tesla suffered a massive 71% drop in profits and a 9% decline in revenue for the first quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Musk clarified though that he has no intention of stepping away from his work with DOGE altogether.</p>
<p>During a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Musk stated that with the <em>&ldquo;major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency&rdquo;</em> now complete, he plans to dedicate more time to Tesla and expects to spend only <em>&ldquo;a day or two per week on government matters.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The EV manufacturer, based in Austin, Texas, reported a net profit of $409 million for the first quarter of 2025, a steep decline from $1.41 billion in the same period a year earlier - the largest year-on-year drop in the company&rsquo;s history. Tesla&rsquo;s revenue also fell from $21.3 billion to $19.3 billion between January and March.</p>

<p>Analysts have largely attributed the steepest sales decline in Tesla&rsquo;s history to Musk&rsquo;s role with DOGE. The tech billionaire has become an increasingly polarizing figure due to his close ties to US President Donald Trump and his work as the head of the unofficial agency tasked with slashing government spending.</p>
<p>Since January, dozens of Tesla-linked locations across the US and internationally have been hit by protests. Musk has suggested the campaign could be a coordinated effort bankrolled by major Democratic donors, including George Soros.</p>
<p>Musk claimed during the call, without providing evidence, that the protests were orchestrated by <em>&ldquo;those who were receiving the wasteful and fraudulent dollars,&rdquo;</em> saying that violent attacks against Tesla are <em>&ldquo;paid for.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think the right thing to do is fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track,&rdquo;</em> he said. <em>&ldquo;If the ship of America goes down, Tesla will go with it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Musk&rsquo;s role as a special government employee is set to conclude by late May, after which the billionaire is expected to return to his private ventures. DOGE, created under Trump&rsquo;s executive order, will remain active until at least 2026.</p>

            <p>A planned high-level meeting in London to discuss the Ukraine conflict has been downgraded after several key European ministers withdrew from the talks. The development comes after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio signaled he would not be present.</p>
<p>The meeting, initially set for Wednesday, was due to include top diplomats from the UK, the US, France, Germany, and Ukraine. However, the sit-down has been postponed and the discussions will now proceed at the level of officials, the UK Foreign Office has confirmed to AFP.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga is still expected to hold a bilateral meeting with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, according to Sky News.</p>
<p>The US State Department earlier confirmed that Rubio would not attend the talks, citing scheduling conflicts. <em>&ldquo;That is not a statement regarding the meetings; it&rsquo;s a statement about logistical issues in his schedule,&rdquo;</em> spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will also not be present and is expected to visit Moscow this week. The US side will instead be represented in London by presidential envoy Keith Kellogg.</p>
<p>Trump recently floated what was described as a <em>&ldquo;final offer&rdquo;</em> to resolve the Ukraine conflict. The proposal would reportedly include <em>&ldquo;de jure&rdquo;</em> US recognition of Crimea as part of Russia and unofficial recognition of Moscow&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;de facto&rdquo;</em> control over the Lugansk and Donetsk People&rsquo;s Republics, as well as the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. The plan is also said to include the lifting of certain sanctions against Russia and opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Crimea and four other regions overwhelmingly voted to join Russia in referendums in 2014 and 2022, respectively. However, Kiev has refused to accept the results of the vote.</p>
<p>A Financial Times report has claimed that Moscow would be ready to freeze hostilities with Ukraine along the current front lines. Commenting on the report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov remarked that <em>&ldquo;a lot of fakes are being published now,&rdquo;</em> calling for people to rely only on <em>&ldquo;the primary sources&rdquo;</em> of information.</p>",Trump,positive

297,The Hill,Walz says he’s ‘very pessimistic’ about Dems winning the Senate,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5272082-tim-walz-pessimistic-dems-winning-senate/,2025-04-29 02:55:07,"<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) said he is “very pessimistic” about Democrats winning back the Senate.</p>



<p>Walz <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4mldjq0KMA&amp;ab_channel=InstituteofPoliticsHarvardKennedySchool"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">joined</a> Harvard University’s Kennedy School Institute of Politics on Monday to discuss the future of the Democratic Party and the Trump administration.</p>



<p>He was asked by ABC News reporter and discussion moderator Brittany Shepherd about his midterm election predictions.</p>



<p>“I think we will take back the House,” Walz said. “I am very pessimistic about the Senate, just to be honest with you.”</p>



<p>“With the way things work, I think it’s a very difficult look.”</p>



<p>Walz noted that former Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) were not able to escape voters’ view of the Democratic Party in the most recent election, both ultimately losing their seats in Congress.</p>



<p>“The thing was, is being associated with national parties and things on these state races, we’re going to have to figure that piece out of, how do we reimagine,” he said.</p>



<p>Walz highlighted that there are 14 Republicans in <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5241877-dems-town-halls-house-gop-target-districts/"">vulnerable districts</a> where Democrats won at the top of the ticket. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He argued there will be a point where some have to distinguish themselves from President Trump to appeal to voters to be reelected in the midterms. Some Republicans have <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5251367-medicaid-cuts-house-republicans-2/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">already changed course</a> on issues like Medicaid as they see the matter as important to voters.</p>



<p>Walz has attempted to generate enthusiasm and make use of Americans’ frustration with the Trump administration’s actions so far by <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5175410-tim-walz-gop-town-hall-events/"">hosting town hall discussions</a> across the country.</p>



<p>“I think there’s a lot of wind at our back, but it’s been 100 days of destruction,” he said. “You think we can survive 550 more? That’s the real challenge. That’s how long it is ‘til the midterm.”</p>",Trump,positive
298,The Hill,Johnson says he believes House can pass Trump agenda by Memorial Day,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5272043-johnson-house-trump-agenda-memorial-day/,2025-04-29 01:55:09,"<p>Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said he believes the House can pass President Trump’s tax agenda by Memorial Day.</p>



<p>Speaking with reporters on Monday, Johnson said he met with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others to discuss where lawmakers were on their “aggressive timetable” to pass the ambitious agenda.</p>



<p>“We’re still on schedule,” Johnson said. “I think we can meet it.”</p>



<p>While <a href=""https://thehill.com/business/domestic-taxes/5271781-bessent-trump-tax-agenda-july-4/"">Bessent announced Monday</a> that July 4 is the new deadline for Congress to pass the agenda, Johnson said he believes it could happen sooner.</p>



<p>He thinks once it passes the House, the Senate can work “expeditiously” to pass it.</p>



<p>“He says July 4 because that’s a big, big birthday for us, and everybody knows that,” Johnson said of Bessent’s new deadline. “But I think, and I hope and believe, that we can get it done sooner than that.”</p>



<p>“I believe we can pass it by Memorial Day,” he added.</p>



<p>Trump and Republicans are set to include a range of tax goals in one package, including making the president’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminating taxes for tips, overtime and Social Security.</p>



<p>The bill could also contain immigration reform, defense funding, and an increase in the debt ceiling, in addition to spending cuts.</p>



<p>Republicans originally wanted to pass the bill by Memorial Day, but some say the goal is unrealistic.</p>



<p>Johnson expressed confidence and the desire to move quickly on raising the debt ceiling, knowing that the “X date is approaching.”</p>



<p>“We want to reduce the deficit while also following through on all of our campaign promises,” he said.</p>",Trump,positive
299,The Hill,"GOP blames tariffs, economic uncertainty for low Trump approval rating",https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5271982-gop-blames-tariffs-economic-uncertainty-trump-approval/,2025-04-29 00:08:48,"<p>Republicans on Capitol Hill are laying the blame for the recent dip in President Trump’s approval ratings at the feet of economic and tariff uncertainty as his administration hits the 100-day mark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tuesday marks the 100th day of the Trump administration 2.0, capping off a topsy-turvy stretch marked by a litany of executive orders, unpredictable tariff policy, a roller coaster on Wall Street and controversial immigration-related efforts.</p>



<p>The whirlwind of a stretch&nbsp;is translating to lagging poll numbers. A <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/27/trump-poll-approval-rating-100-days/"">Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll</a>&nbsp;released on Sunday found that Trump’s approval rating among adult Americans dropped by six points over the past two months, from 45 percent in February to 39 percent in March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The numbers are similar in a survey by <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-poll-approval.html"">The New York Times/Siena College</a>. Forty-two percent of voters nationwide approve of the job Trump is doing.</p>



<p>Gop lawmakers are chalking the numbers up to the recent economic tumult.</p>



<p>“The president, among a lot of people … still has a great deal of confidence,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), a member of Republican leadership. “I think what’s concerning people — and I think he knows this — are the economics of, and the uncertainty around this tariff protocol. I think that’s what you see reflected.”</p>



<p>Capito also referenced the administration’s work at the border to shut off the flow of migrants.</p>



<p>But she indicated that the economic headwinds can turn around quickly. Lawmakers have been clamoring the administration to strike trade deals in the coming months after Trump suspended many of his “Liberation Day” levies.</p>



<p>“I fully expect all that to change because I do think he’s turning a big ship here, and it’s going to take a little bit of time,” she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Numerous GOP lawmakers have made their unease known surrounding the tariff troubles, with many trying to give Trump space to maneuver despite their personal reservations.</p>



<p>They also looked for ways to make their concerns known without directly criticizing the president, including issuing harsh words for Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser and &nbsp;the most pro-tariff voice in the administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Republicans believe there are other sources that have also fed the dipping poll numbers, including some uncertainty surrounding the work conducted in recent months by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a whole lot of people who are really supportive of reducing the size of the executive branch, and I get that,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said. “But I think for a select group of individuals out there, they’ve been told that it could impact Medicare, it could impact Medicaid. They’ve been told it’s going to significantly reduce our ability to do health care and so forth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of it is a fear that these things are coming yet,” Rounds said. “And they haven’t seen it, but they’re worried about and they’re afraid that there might be something coming down the line that they’re not aware of yet.”</p>



<p>Despite those troubles, congressional Republicans are continuing to stand by Trump, brushing off the public sentiment as the typical ebb-and-flow of a White House tenure.</p>



<p>“These presidential terms are roller coasters sometimes,” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told reporters when asked why the public is turning on Trump’s policies “There’s been a little tumult in the markets with the tariffs policy and all of that, but I think all this is settling out.”</p>



<p>“I was out speaking with donors and party faithful over the last week,” he added. “People are in very good spirits, they understand that this is a long game to be played, and this is all gonna settle out.”</p>



<p>Rep. Lisa McClain (Mich.), the chair of the House GOP conference, recognized the “short-term discomfort,” but dismissed its significance.</p>



<p>“They haven’t slipped that much if you look at the big scope, I think it’s on individual issues” she said of the polls. “He’s done a tremendous amount in the first 100 days, I mean, just compare and contrast the two administrations.”</p>



<p>Johnson and other Republicans are also going to be leaning hard on their efforts on the GOP’s tax cut package that is <a href=""https://thehill.com/business/domestic-taxes/5268443-gop-trump-agenda-tax-medicaid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">still being cobbled together</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, met with the Speaker, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and top tax writers at the Capitol on Monday. They emerged preaching unity and <a href=""https://thehill.com/business/domestic-taxes/5271781-bessent-trump-tax-agenda-july-4/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">laying out a Fourth of July soft deadline</a> to get that package to the president’s desk — setting up a two-month grind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The House is moving things along quickly, and the Senate is in lockstep. We think that they are in substantial agreement,” Bessent said.</p>



<p>Johnson pointed to the developing package when asked about Trump’s lagging poll numbers.</p>



<p>“I think it’s gonna be a great piece of legislation, it’s gonna solve a lot of problems, it’s gonna be turbo-fuel, a turbo-boost for the economy, and we’re looking forward to getting that done,” he told reporters.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Trump has also dealt with some self-inflicted wounds in parts of his administration, headlined by the recent firings and tumult at the Pentagon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5259399-republicans-defense-secretary-pete-hegseth-signal/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">found himself at the center of a storm</a> himself in recent weeks despite consistent backing from Trump, who over the weekend indicated that the ex-Fox News host has some work to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think he’s gonna get it together,” Trump told The Atlantic recently about Hegseth. “I had a talk with him, a positive talk, but I had a talk with him.”</p>



<p>A handful of top staffers have been fired or reassigned in recent weeks, including multiple aides who were longtime Hegseth loyalists. John Ullyot, a former Pentagon spokesperson, also wrote in an opinion piece that the Pentagon in recent months is in “disarray” and pointed the finger in Hegseth’s direction.</p>



<p>This has left some congressional Republicans alarmed to various degrees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think they’re still trying to find their way in regards to who the personnel are that fit,” said Rounds. “You’ve got folks that want to serve and sometimes they fit the right spots, [but] sometimes they serve better in other areas, and I think that’s going on right now.”</p>



<p>Some Republicans also believe that a rebuild was needed following the exit of the Biden administration, so Trump should be given more grace than initially thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With everything he’s had to do, I’m surprised it’s above ten [percent],” said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.). “The last president we had didn’t make any decisions and put us in a hole.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s having to make a lot of decisions nobody likes,” Tuberville added.</p>",Trump,positive

<p><a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/146"">The measure </a>cleared the House in an overwhelming 409-2 vote, with 22 members not voting. Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Eric Burilson (R-Mo.) were the sole ""no"" votes.</p>



<p>The bill would make it a federal crime to knowingly post or threaten to publish realistic, computer-generated pornographic images and videos that attempt to show identifiable, real people on social media and elsewhere online.</p>



<p>Trump indicated last month he plans to sign the bill. </p>



<p>""The Senate just passed the Take It Down Act. Once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law,"" Trump told a joint session of Congress in early March. ""And I'm going to use that bill for myself too if you don't mind because nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody.""</p>



<p>First lady Melania Trump also <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5173560-melania-trump-roundtable-democrats/"">came out in support of the bill,</a> attending a roundtable on the measure last month. </p>



<p>She was quick to applaud the passage on Monday evening. </p>



<p>“Today’s bipartisan passage of the&nbsp;Take It Down Act&nbsp;is a powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children,"" the first lady wrote in a statement.</p>



<p>The measure was sponsored by Senate Commerce Chair Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in the upper chamber, while Reps. Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) and Madeline Dean (D-Pa.) were the co-leads on the House version.</p>



<p>Cruz celebrated the bill's passage on Monday, calling it a ""historic win in the fight to protect victims of revenge porn and deepfake abuse.""</p>



<p>""By requiring social media companies to take down this abusive content quickly, we are sparing victims from repeated trauma and holding predators accountable,"" he wrote in a statement.</p>



<p>Massie explained his ""no"" vote on X writing, ""I’m voting NO because I feel this is a slippery slope, ripe for abuse, with unintended consequences.""</p>



<p>The bill marks the first youth online safety bill to pass Congress this session, handing some lawmakers a win after failing to pass most related legislation last year.  </p>



<p>Tech safety groups and families have led lobbying efforts for years to pass legislation like the Take It Down Act, with hopes of holding technology companies accountable for social media harms, specifically on young children.</p>



<p>Among the bills being pushed by many online safety groups is the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which would create regulations for the kinds of features tech and social media companies offer kids online. </p>



<p>KOSA passed the Senate in a 91-3 vote last session but did not make it to the House floor amid concerns from GOP leadership that it would stifle free speech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some lawmakers have expressed concerns Trump would side with technology companies due to his newfound connections with some Big Tech leaders, Cruz told The Hill last month he does not anticipate that being the case.</p>



<p>“Every conversation I’ve had with the Trump administration on this topic has evidenced a commitment to protecting free speech and ending Big Tech censorship,” he said, pointing to the president and first lady's support of the Take It Down Act.</p>



<p>Some tech policy groups, including Americans for Responsible Innovation (ARI), an AI advocacy group, celebrated the bill's passage.</p>



<p>“For the first time in years, Congress is passing legislation to protect vulnerable communities online and requiring tech giants to clean up their act,” ARI President Brad Carson said. “This bill is going to make a difference in the lives of victims and prevent another generation from being targeted with non-consensual intimate deepfakes.""</p>



<p>Meanwhile, others in the policy space worry the Take It Down Act will end up stifling speech.</p>



<p>""The TAKE IT DOWN Act is a missed opportunity for Congress to meaningfully help victims of nonconsensual intimate imagery,"" said Becca Branum, the deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Free Expression Project. </p>



<p>""The best of intentions can't make up for the bill's dangerous implications for constitutional speech and privacy online,"" she said Monday. ""The Take It Down Act, while well-intentioned, was written without appropriate safeguards to prevent the mandated removal of content that is not nonconsensual intimate imagery, making it vulnerable to constitutional challenge and abusive takedown requests."" </p>",Trump,positive

302,The Hill,Trump executive order requires truck drivers to speak English,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5271893-trump-executive-order-truck-drivers-speak-english/,2025-04-28 23:16:40,"<p>President Trump signed an executive order on Monday that requires commercial truck drivers in the United States to be proficient in English.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://x.com/rapidresponse47/status/1916976810639724997?s=46&amp;t=lOQdKdBuwkxRDUIdYsuoKg"">text of the order</a> acknowledges the essential role that truck drivers play in the U.S. economy and the livelihood of American people.</p>



<p>“Every day, truckers perform the demanding and dangerous work of transporting the Nation’s goods to businesses, customers, and communities safely, reliably, and efficiently,” the order said.</p>



<p>Trump <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5171301-trump-signs-executive-order-designating-english-official-language-of-us/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">designated English</a> as the country’s official language in an executive order in March. In his order on Monday, the president said proficiency in English should be non-negotiable for professional drivers.</p>



<p>“They should be able to read and understand traffic signs, communicate with traffic safety, border patrol, agricultural checkpoints, and cargo weight-limit station officers,” the order said. “Drivers need to provide feedback to their employers and customers and receive related directions in English.”</p>



<p>“This is common sense.”</p>



<p>Under the order, a driver must be able to read and speak English “sufficiently to converse with the general public” to operate a commercial vehicle in the U.S.</p>



<p>“My Administration will enforce the law to protect the safety of American truckers, drivers, passengers, and others, including by upholding the safety enforcement regulations that ensure that anyone behind the wheel of a commercial vehicle is properly qualified and proficient in our national language, English,” the order said.</p>



<p>The order states that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy will issue a new guidance on English proficiency testing and enforcement policies. A violation of the English language proficiency requirement would put a driver “out-of-service,” the order said.</p>



<p>“You might not know, but there’s a lot of communication problems between truckers on the road with federal officials and local officials, as well, which obviously is a public safety risk,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing on Monday.</p>



<p>The decision was celebrated by Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA). </p>



<p>""OOIDA and the 150,000 truckers we proudly represent strongly support President Trump’s decision to resume enforcement of English proficiency requirements for commercial drivers,” said OOIDA President Todd Spencer said in a statement. “Basic English skills are essential for reading critical road signs, understanding emergency instructions, and interacting with law enforcement."" </p>

304,The Hill,Jeffries says fate of Trump agenda is ‘matter of life and death’,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5271850-jeffries-says-fate-of-trump-agenda-is-matter-of-life-and-death/,2025-04-28 22:27:26,"<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said Monday the adoption of President Trump’s domestic agenda would literally hurt and kill people due to cuts to federal health care programs. </p>



<p>The Democratic leader said the Republicans’ designs for Medicaid, in particular, would erode coverage for millions of Americans at the expense of their well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They want to end Medicaid as we know it,” Jeffries told reporters in the Capitol. “They're going to hurt children, hurt families, hurt seniors, hurt people with disabilities, close hospitals, shut down nursing homes — and people will die.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a matter of life and death.”</p>



<p>The warning arrives as Congress is returning to Washington from a two-week spring recess, which Democrats used to stage hundreds of events around the country to amplify their message that Trump’s agenda would hurt poor and working-class Americans who rely on certain federal benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Republicans have dismissed the allegations as political theater. While their budget plan sets the stage for hundreds of billions of cuts to Medicaid, they say the savings can be found by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in the massive health care program, which provides coverage to more than 70 million people.</p>



<p>Still, recent polls indicate that even Republican voters are wary of some of the major pieces of Trump’s agenda, including how it deals with Medicaid. And GOP leaders have advised rank-and-file Republicans to avoid in-person town halls, where clashes with angry constituents have churned headlines for months — an avoidance strategy that has not been overlooked by Democrats, who are jumping into GOP districts to fill the void <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5256475-house-democrats-republican-tactics/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">with town halls of their own</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These extremists — they want to take health care away from the American people. And they know that their constituents aren’t here for it, which is why Republicans have been on the run during the last two weeks during the district work period,” Jeffries said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Democrats are leaning into town hall meetings all across America. Republicans are running away from them. But now there's a moment of accountability.”</p>



<p>The competing claims between the parties will soon be put to the test, as Republican-led committees are beginning this week to <a href=""https://thehill.com/business/domestic-taxes/5268443-gop-trump-agenda-tax-medicaid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">fill in the policy details</a> of the vague budget outline GOP leaders had passed through both chambers earlier in the month.</p>



<p>As part of that budget, the Energy and Commerce Committee is charged with finding $880 billion in spending reductions over the next decade. That figure, according to the Congressional Budget Office, cannot be reached without hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid.</p>



<p>Practically speaking, Democrats are powerless to block Trump’s agenda, since Republicans are moving it on an obscure procedural track, known as reconciliation, that sidesteps the Senate filibuster. But politically, Democrats are racing to highlight the more controversial elements of the GOP package, hoping the political pressure on vulnerable Republicans will convince them to oppose the legislation when it comes to the floor for a final vote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now is the moment of truth. Will a handful of House Republicans step up on behalf of the American people and prevent the largest Medicaid cut in American history?” Jeffries said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now is a time to choose.”</p>",Trump,negative
305,The Hill,Michigan Democrat files articles of impeachment against Trump,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5271810-michigan-democrat-trump-impeachment/,2025-04-28 22:19:40,"<p>Michigan Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar announced Monday he had filed articles of impeachment against President Trump.</p>



<p>“I have introduced articles of impeachment against President Trump,” Thanedar <a href=""https://x.com/repshrithanedar/status/1916920864521519363"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">said in his announcement online</a>. “When Trump ignores the Constitution, Congress, and the courts, he is not ‘fighting for America.’ He is tearing it down and endangering our democracy.”</p>



<p>Thanedar said he was introducing seven articles of impeachment against Trump for various actions, <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5185620-rubio-ice-arrest-pro-palestinian-columbia-mahmoud-khalil-green-card-dhs-trump-immigration-crackdown/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">including the deportation</a> of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man mistakenly sent to El Salvador, and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) <a href=""https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5150593-doe-government-efficiency-savings/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cutting funds without</a> congressional approval.</p>



<p>The articles of impeachment are unlikely to go anywhere in the GOP House, where Republican support would be needed to win a vote on the articles. The House votes on whether to impeach a president, while the Senate votes on whether to convict a president. In the Senate, where the GOP also has a majority, a two-thirds majority is needed to win a conviction.</p>



<p>Still, the introduction of the articles of impeachment highlights just how angry Democrats are with Trump on a range of issues. </p>



<p>“Donald Trump has already done real damage to our democracy, but defying a unanimous 9-0 Supreme Court ruling, that has to be the one final straw,” Thanedar said, referencing a decision on the Abrego Garcia case. “It’s time we impeach Donald J. Trump.”</p>



<p>Thanedar said among Trump’s impeachable actions were his <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5240707-trump-pause-tariffs-markets/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">steep tariff agenda</a> impacting global markets, his <a href=""https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5256509-courts-weigh-white-house-workarounds-to-keep-ap-iced-out/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">treatment of reporters</a> and the First Amendment, his bribery and corruption in the justice system, and his <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5246249-new-york-judge-doge-treasury-data-access/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">obtaining of Americans’ personal data</a>.</p>



<p>“Article seven, tyrannical overreach,” Thanedar said. “Finally, and most importantly, he is attempting to consolidate unchecked power and erode the constitutional limits of the presidency,” Thanedar said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“In this country, we have presidents, not kings. That’s not just misconduct. It’s impeachable misconduct,” he continued.</p>



<p>Concern has grown among Democrats after the Trump Organization <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5266019-donald-trump-store-merchandise-third-term-2028/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">unveiled “Trump 2028”</a> hats on its website in support of the president’s suggestion that he could <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5224002-trump-third-term-debate/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">seek a third term</a> in office.</p>



<p>“If we let this stand, we are saying the president is above the law. That the United States Constitution is optional,” Thanedar said. “I won’t be silent and I’m calling on all my colleagues, Democrats, Republicans and independents, to stand up with me.”</p>



<p>“Enough is enough. Donald J. Trump must be impeached,” he concluded.</p>",Trump,positive
306,The Hill,5 ways Trump reshaped the government in the first 100 days,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5271255-trump-executive-actions-federal-government/,2025-04-28 22:05:23,"<p>President Trump’s first 100 days have upended norms in the White House and across the federal government with a slew of executive actions and policies that aim to fulfill his key campaign promises.</p>



<p>It has included the slashing of several agencies, the firings of thousands of federal workers and the skirting of courts amid a wide swath of legal cases challenging the administration.</p>



<p>Here are five ways Trump has reshaped the government in the first three months of his second term.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Federal agency overhauls, cuts</h2>



<p>The president brought in billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aimed to overhaul the federal government by identifying what it sees as waste at agencies.</p>



<p>At least 121,000 federal workers have been fired or laid off, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/26/politics/federal-layoffs-trump-musk-dg/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">according to a CNN analysis</a>, and at least 30 agencies have been impacted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DOGE gutted the U.S. Agency for International Development, massively reduced the staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs, and teamed up with secretaries for restructuring at agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services. Some of the eliminations were swift and widespread, prompting Trump to relay publicly that he wanted Musk to cut with a “scalpel” instead of a “hatchet.”</p>



<p>Senior White House officials argue that the overhaul is necessary to “return power” to the elected officials and away from the unelected bureaucrats of the federal government. Musk came on as a Trump adviser during his campaign, and the president put him in charge of DOGE.</p>



<p>“We’re living in the prison of bureaucracy that is completely antithetical to democracy. One of the biggest changes the president has made — primary fight is an intrabranch fight. A fight between the president and the bureaucracy,” officials said.</p>



<p>Following his work, Musk is easing off of his special government role and will leave secretaries at the helm of ongoing changes. Musk’s Tesla car company has become a target, and some public perception of his work has been panned.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Executive orders bypassing Congress</h2>



<p>Trump has signed more than 140 executive orders in his first 100 days in office, according to the White House.</p>



<p>Starting on the day he was sworn in, Trump has acted on everything from immigration and social issues to Jan. 6 defendants and education, targeting law firms and much more.</p>



<p>Those executive actions, which Trump executed from the Oval Office, left out Congress, which holds the power of the purse. The GOP-led House and Senate chambers have said little about any of their power being eroded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The president signed one major piece of legislation — the Laken Riley Act. The bill, <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5113714-trump-signs-laken-riley-act/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">signed in January</a>, required the detention of a broad swath of immigrants without legal status if they have been accused of theft, burglary or shoplifting.</p>



<p>The White House is expected to increase its pressure on Congress to act on tax and border legislation in the next 100 days, and Trump will increase his outreach to Congress as a package gets closer to passage, according to senior White House officials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) met with the president Monday about his agenda, but Congress has a long way to go to get a bill in the works passed due to the GOP’s very slim House majority and competing priorities.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Skirting court challenges</h2>



<p>The White House faces dozens of challenges to its executive orders, stemming from actions on deportations, firing federal government workers and transgender troops in the military.</p>



<p>The legal challenge to Trump’s use of the 18th century Alien Enemies Act has made the most headlines. The act enables immigrants to be deported due to an “invasion” of a foreign nation.</p>



<p>Hundreds of migrants have been swept up in deportations as a result, with the administration insisting they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang out of Venezuela or that they committed other criminal acts, without providing proof.</p>



<p>In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the administration admitted in court documents it had deported the El Salvador national in “administrative error,” but the White House has since contested that notion. Despite being ordered by the Supreme Court to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return, the administration insists he will not be returning to the U.S.</p>



<p>The administration has <a href=""https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5235939-doj-supreme-court-deported-man/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">argued the courts cannot mandate his return</a> since he is now in the hands of Salvadoran authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another case, a federal judge last week <a href=""https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5265622-judge-finds-trumps-sanctuary-cities-order-likely-unconstitutional/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ruled that an executive order</a> to ensure “sanctuary” jurisdictions “do not receive access to federal funds” <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69623767/111/city-and-county-of-san-francisco-v-donald-j-trump/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">is likely unconstitutional</a>. Trump then on Monday signed an executive order to further crack down on sanctuary cities for not coordinating with federal immigration authorities.</p>



<p>Senior White House officials argue that the courts are siding with the bureaucracy.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Expanding roles of DOJ, ICE</h2>



<p>Trump has expanded the role of two agencies behind much of the enforcement of his top priorities — the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>



<p>Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to take on tasks ranging from <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5266301-trump-memo-targeting-actblue/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">investigating allegations</a> of straw donations from foreigners to the Democratic Party donor platform ActBlue to leading a task force to “eradicate anti-Christian bias.”</p>



<p>The administration has also <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5268277-trump-administration-civil-rights/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">undertaken a series of policy changes</a> at the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, directing attorneys to focus on priorities like&nbsp;“keeping men out of women’s sports” and “eradicating anti-Christian bias.”</p>



<p>ICE has also been tasked with rapidly increasing its deportation numbers. It conducted a <a href=""https://thehill.com/immigration/5270216-ice-florida-law-enforcement-arrests/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">“first-of-its kind” operation</a> with state law enforcement in Florida to arrest nearly 100 people over a matter of a few days, and it detained more than <a href=""https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5270407-ice-raid-undocumented-immigrants-colorado-nightclub/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">100 people in a raid</a> at a nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo., early Sunday morning.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href=""https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5267879-hannah-dugan-milkaukee-county-judge-arrested-fbi/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">FBI took the unprecedented step</a> Friday to arrest Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah C. Dugan, alleging she tried to impede Trump’s immigration agenda by helping an immigrant illegally in the U.S. avoid arrest in the courtroom.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Targeting of private institutions</h2>



<p>The president has targeted various private institutions, including major universities and law firms, by withholding funding and aiming to undercut business.</p>



<p>The administration took away $2.2 billion in funding for Harvard after the university refused to bow to Trump’s demands, which included changes to its hiring and admission practices, as well as eliminating its diversity, equity and inclusion programs.</p>



<p>While <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5265135-trump-harvard-democracy-funding-garber/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Harvard has sued the administration</a>, Trump has also sought to target the university’s tax-exempt status and his Department of Homeland Security has threatened to eliminate its ability to enroll international students.</p>



<p>Law firms like Perkins Coie and WilmerHale have drawn Trump’s ire for working with his political adversaries. The president has directed various agencies to cut off those firms employees’ security clearances, access to federal government facilities and to review any contracts the government has with the law firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perkins Coie and WilmerHale <a href=""https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5263915-trump-executive-orders-perkins-coie-willmerhale/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">have asked the courts for legal relief</a> from Trump’s orders, arguing they are unlawful and spell disaster for their ability to perform legal work involving the government.&nbsp;The DOJ has fought back, arguing that it’s within the president’s discretion to decide who to trust with the nation’s secrets.</p>",Trump,negative
307,The Hill,White House sets new July 4 deadline for Trump tax agenda,https://thehill.com/business/domestic-taxes/5271781-bessent-trump-tax-agenda-july-4/,2025-04-28 21:58:22,"<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that July 4 is the new deadline for lawmakers to pass President Trump's ambitious tax agenda. </p>



<p>Bessent and Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, met on Capitol Hill Monday with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and top tax writers.</p>



<p>Congress returned to Washington on Monday to kick off a key stretch to get the package, which includes broad swaths of Trump's agenda, passed. Republicans aim to pass it with only GOP votes but must first <a href=""https://thehill.com/business/domestic-taxes/5268443-gop-trump-agenda-tax-medicaid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">work out significant disagreements</a>.</p>



<p>Bessent on Monday hailed the unity among all factions before laying out the new target date.</p>



<p>“The House is moving things along quickly, and the Senate is in lockstep. We think that they are in substantial agreement,” Bessent said. “We hope we can have this tax portion done by the Fourth of July.”</p>



<p>Trump and Republicans are set to include a potpourri of party tax goals in the single package, including potentially making the tax cuts passed in 2017 permanent and eliminating taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security. Republicans also expect the bill to contain immigration reform, Pentagon funding, an increase in the debt ceiling and steep spending cuts.</p>



<p>Lawmakers had initially wanted to deliver the package by Memorial Day, and Johnson says he still intends to get the measure through the House by then. But many Senate Republicans view it as a lofty and unrealistic goal.</p>



<p>The announcement of the July 4 goal for the bill comes just days ahead of when the Treasury Department is expected to release an updated projection of when the U.S. will exhaust its ability to pay the national debt, known as the X date.</p>



<p>The deadline revelation also comes only days before lawmakers expect to find out more information from the Treasury Department about the expected debt ceiling X date.</p>



<p>The X date is widely viewed as the true deadline to pass the tax agenda because it is also expected to contain at least a $4 trillion increase in the debt ceiling.</p>



<p>That date is expected in the summertime, but it could complicate the GOP's plans if it is bumped up closer to July 4.</p>



<p>“We don’t have a new X date yet,” Bessent said, pointing to the continued gathering of taxes in April, but he added that revenues are up this year. “We may have a better calculation toward the end of the week or next week.”</p>



<p>Bessent also made clear that even if the X date is set for before July 4, the debt ceiling will be raised one way or another. </p>



<p>“The U.S. will never miss the X date,” Bessent said.</p>",Trump,positive

<p>The Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services launched a Title VI investigation over reports of race-based discrimination in the journal’s operation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Harvard Law Review’s article selection process appears to pick winners and losers on the basis of race, employing a spoils system in which the race of the legal scholar is as, if not more, important than the merit of the submission,”&nbsp;Department of Education acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said.</p>



<p>“Title VI’s demands are clear: recipients of federal financial assistance may not discriminate on the basis of race, color, or national origin. No institution—no matter its pedigree, prestige, or wealth—is above the law. The Trump Administration will not allow Harvard, or any other recipients of federal funds, to trample on anyone’s civil rights,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation is based on reports that one editor at the Harvard Law Review said “a piece should be subject to expedited review because the author was a minority” and another who allegedly said it was concerned most of the individuals who wanted to reply to an article about police reform “are white men.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Hill has reached out to Harvard for comment. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation comes as the Trump administration and Harvard are in a legal battle after the federal government <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5248891-trump-administration-freezes-more-than-2-billion-in-grants-to-harvard/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">pulled $2 billion in funding</a> over the Ivy League school not changing its policies based on the president’s demands.

<p>“Congratulations to Mark Carney and the Liberal Party on their election victory. The bond between Europe and Canada is strong — and growing stronger,” <a href=""https://x.com/vonderleyen/status/1917099441716383991"" target=""_blank"">European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said</a>.</p>



<p>“I look forward to working closely together, both bilaterally and within the G7. We&#8217;ll defend our shared democratic values, promote multilateralism, and champion free and fair trade,” she added.</p>



<p>“The EU and Canada have a long and close partnership. We are allies and strong trade partners. We share the same values, and attachment to the UN Charter and the rules-based international order. We will continue working closely together, including in the G7 format,” <a href=""https://x.com/eucopresident/status/1917111290071331106"" target=""_blank"">said European Council President António Costa</a>.</p>



<p>Carney, who previously headed up two G7 central banks and worked for more than a decade at Goldman Sachs, <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/28/mark-carney-wins-canada-prime-minister-election-00314480"" target=""_blank"">was elected</a> Canada’s prime minister Monday night, after running on his economic record — and standing up to the belligerent Trump. Carney defeated the Conservative Party led by Pierre Poilievre, though it is still unclear whether he will run a <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/federal-election/2025-results/"" target=""_blank"">majority or minority government</a>.</p>



<p>Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof echoed von der Leyen and Costa&#8217;s sentiments. “Canada and the Netherlands share historic ties and common values, and work together&nbsp;in many fields like trade and economics, security and defence,” <a href=""https://x.com/MinPres/status/1917092880600207621"" target=""_blank"">he said.</a></p>



<p>“I look forward to continuing the close cooperation between our countries and to welcoming him to the NATO Summit in The Hague on 24 and 25 June,” Schoof added.</p>



<p>“Congratulations to Mark Carney on your election victory,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement.</p>



<p>“The U.K. and Canada are the closest of allies, partners and friends &#8230; We will work together to deepen our economic relationship to deliver security for hardworking people in the U.K. and Canada — which we were both elected to do,” Starmer added.</p>



<p><a href=""https://x.com/MichealMartinTD/status/1917112126918770833"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin</a> said: “Irish-Canadian relations are deep and strong, based on shared values. I look forward to working with Canada’s new government.”</p>



<p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden also congratulated Carney, praising his leadership qualities. &nbsp;“I’m confident Mark will be a strong leader for the fundamental values and interests Canadians and Americans share,” <a href=""https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1917056642027311316"" target=""_blank"">Biden said</a>.</p>



<p>Carney&#8217;s campaign focused on “Trump-proofing” Canada and uniting a country that he said has witnessed a surge in patriotic sentiment in response to Trump’s suggestion that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state.</p>



<p>Following his narrow electoral win, Carney continued to strike a defiant tone against the U.S. president. “America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country.

<p>The morning political podcast which gives you all need for the day ahead in 20 minutes, usually with Sky News&#8217; Sam Coates and Politico&#8217;s Anne McElvoy.</p>



<p>But, for this episode, Anne is somewhere over the Atlantic travelling back from the US so Sam is joined by Politico&#8217;s Tim Ross.</p>



<p>Mark Carney&#8217;s Liberal Party has won the Canadian election. It&#8217;ll give Keir Starmer a centre-left ally at G7 but how will the PM position himself now in the Trump-Carney standoff?</p>



<p>Elsewhere, with political leaders out and about in Bristol, Scunthorpe, South Cambridgeshire and Wiltshire &#8211; there are plenty of clues about the biggest target seats in the last 48 hours before local election voting.</p>



<p>To find lists of candidates in all the local elections, you can search here:&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter/your-election-information"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter/your-election-information</a></strong></p>",Trump,positive
321,Politico Europe,The unlikely election of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/29/the-unlikely-election-of-prime-minister-mark-carney-00314555?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication,2025-04-29 07:14:13,"<p>OTTAWA — Only this campaign could have produced Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>



<p>The former banker with the sober demeanor of a natural technocrat persuaded millions of Canadians he was the guy to lead the nation amid an unprecedented onslaught of threats and ridicule from the brash President Donald Trump.</p>



<p>“Good luck to the Great people of Canada,” Trump messaged on Election Day, imploring Canadians to take his side over anybody actually on the ballot.</p>



<p>The outburst from the White House in the 11th hour of a snap election campaign served up yet another reminder to Canadians why they were prioritizing calm and competence above everything else.</p>



<p>Since returning to the White House, Trump has poked and prodded Canadians, enraging them with tariffs and annexation talk while whipping up patriotic sentiment.</p>



<p>When Justin Trudeau announced his resignation in January amid deep unpopularity, Carney was not yet a politician. By March, he’d been chosen by the Liberals to take over as leader and prime minister — and on Monday, millions of Canadians elected the seasoned banker as the antidote to Trump.</p>



<p>“My message to every Canadian is this,” Carney said early Tuesday morning with results still being counted. “No matter where you live, no matter what language you speak, no matter how you voted, I will always do my best to represent everyone who calls Canada.”</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Boring Man takes the plunge</strong></h3>



<p>Carney doesn’t ooze charisma. But that is exactly the point, says the first Liberal lawmaker to back Carney’s party leadership bid following Trudeau’s stunning exit announcement.</p>



<p>“We’re not looking for charisma, we’re looking for competence and someone who’s real and someone who’s authentic,” Ali Ehsassi told POLITICO in his Toronto campaign office on the final weekend before Election Day.</p>



<p>Ehsassi met Carney about a year and a half ago. He was also in the room last April, when Carney delivered a keynote at a think tank event in a Toronto hotel ballroom.</p>



<p>What he saw was an explainer, not a campaigner.</p>



<p>“It wasn’t political language. It wasn’t sloganeering. So I was a bit concerned, to be honest with you, at that particular event,” Ehsassi says.</p>



<p>On the hustings, Carney’s voice occasionally rises an octave or two, but much of his tone and cadence on the stump resembles a speech he might’ve delivered in recent years to a global conference on green finance. One step above a lecture.</p>



<p>“I think that’s very deliberate,” Ehsassi says.</p>



<p>Most political observers did not predict that a numbers guy who lacked political experience could turn around his party’s fortunes. When Trudeau finally announced his resignation, the Liberals had reached a depressing nadir in the polls.</p>



<p>Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was 25 points ahead, all but assured of a win at the next opportunity. Liberal staffers had been jumping ship for months, and many of those who remained had lost hope of a comeback.</p>



<p>“Bankers are very cautious personalities,” Ehsassi says. “But despite the challenges that were quite obvious to everyone … he had the backbone to take the plunge.”</p>



<p>In January, transformative events rolled out at remarkable speed.</p>



<p>A newly inaugurated Trump ratcheted up his tariff fight with Canada and intensified his musings about absorbing the country. Carney was battling for the leadership with former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, whose resignation in December supercharged calls for Trudeau’s exit.</p>



<p>He out-fundraised Freeland and racked up endorsements, running away with the leadership when all the votes were counted on March 9. Nine days later, after a whirlwind trip to Europe and a spate of high-profile Trudeau-era policy reversals, Carney called an election.</p>



<p></p>



<p>By the time he boarded his campaign bus, the Liberals had their first polling lead since 2023. He’d barely had time to measure the drapes, let alone hire a staff.</p>



<p>The polls kept getting better as a curious trend emerged: Progressive New Democratic Party voters were abandoning their flock for the centrist banker. Even Francophone voters in Quebec didn’t seem to mind Carney’s rudimentary French.</p>



<p>Everything, all at once, seemed to be breaking his way.</p>



<p>But don’t call that simple luck, says Seamus O’Regan, a former Cabinet minister who left politics before the election.</p>



<p>“There were a number of things that lined up for him, no question. But there’s always an opportunity to get that wrong,” O’Regan told POLITICO. “The onus is on [him] not to screw that up. There were all sorts of opportunities where he could have and he didn’t, and he’s proven himself to be a lot more adept at retail politics and strategy than a lot of people were giving him credit for at the beginning.”</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>The ‘existential economic threat’</strong></h3>



<p>Carney’s emergence as a leadership candidate was enough to convince Anita Anand, a Cabinet minister who was on her way out of politics in January, to return for a second act.</p>



<p>In a late-March interview with POLITICO, the former law professor at the University of Toronto insisted her decision to run again only two weeks after announcing her return to academic life was not influenced by the upturn in her electoral prospects.</p>



<p>In the first week of the campaign, she felt the difference at the doorstep with voters.</p>



<p>“Six months ago, eight months ago, we did not have the Canada-U.S. situation that we have had, and have right now, and people thought, ‘the Liberals have had their chance, and now it’s time for change,’” she said.</p>



<p>What changed? “It’s the threat. The existential economic threat.”</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Long time coming</strong></h3>



<p>When Trump was elected last November, Carney was still officially on the political sidelines, a perpetual politician-in-waiting looking for the moment to pounce.</p>



<p>For years, the banker with heaps of experience in both the private and public sectors had privately confided his interest in the Prime Minister’s Office.</p>



<p>Rumors first surfaced in 2012, when the then-Bank of Canada governor&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/nothing-inappropriate-about-cottage-stay-during-liberal-courtship-carney/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>vacationed at the Nova Scotia cottage of Scott Brison</u></a>, a prominent Liberal and fellow banker.</p>



<p>Those particular whispers amounted to nothing.</p>



<p>When he returned from a seven-year stint atop the Bank of England, Carney’s tip-toeing into politics commenced in earnest. In 2020, when Trudeau dumped his first finance minister, Bill Morneau, The Globe and Mail’s sources&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-finance-minister-bill-morneau-could-be-replaced-over-clashes-with/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>mused about Carney making the jump</u></a>.</p>



<p>Carney later&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/carney-speech-liberal-convention-2021-wherry-1.5982396"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>came out as a Liberal</u></a>&nbsp;at a party convention in 2021. He honed his centrist message at ballroom keynotes — like the one Ehsassi heard last year — that increasingly fascinated curious Liberals hungry for a change.</p>



<p>Still, the forever-maybe candidate held off openly auditioning for Trudeau’s job.</p>



<p>Last summer, The Globe published reports of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trudeau-says-hes-trying-to-recruit-carney-but-did-not-say-if-its-to/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>friction between Trudeau and Freeland</u></a>. Both denied any trouble was brewing, but that jarring episode reignited rumors that Trudeau was courting Carney for a Cabinet role.</p>



<p>In September, he took on an economic advisory role with the party — another baby step into rough-and-tumble politics that timed to a brewing caucus rebellion in the fall.</p>



<p>By November, the internal fracas had failed to oust Trudeau. Then came the bombshell that instantly transformed Canadian politics.</p>



<p>On Dec. 16, hours before Freeland was set to deliver her government’s latest economic plan, she abruptly quit Cabinet. Again, the Globe reported that the PM had&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-bloc-quebecois-dissolve-parliament-call/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>offered Carney a Cabinet job</u></a>&nbsp;as minister of finance.</p>



<p>WIthin weeks, Trudeau was on the way out and Carney was in.</p>



<p>“He was very, very adept at dancing, yeah,” O’Regan says of the prime minister’s sense of political timing. “And when the opportunity came, he went for it, and none of that’s easy.”</p>",Trump,positive

323,Politico Europe,Mark Carney elected Canada’s prime minister,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/28/mark-carney-wins-canada-prime-minister-election-00314480?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication,2025-04-29 03:17:40,"<p>OTTAWA — Mark Carney was elected Canada’s prime minister Monday, CBC News and CTV News both projected<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>with Canadians giving the Liberal leader the mandate he sought to take on President Donald Trump’s tariffs and trade policy.</p>



<p>Carney cemented the Liberals’ fourth-straight term in government, a rare feat in Canadian politics — while holding back the Conservative Party led by Pierre Poilievre. The win shows that voters rejected Trump’s brand of populism — which Liberals argued Poilievre had come to represent.</p>



<p>Carney, who was seen to move the Liberals to the center following the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, ran on his economic record. He headed up two G7 central banks, worked for more than a decade at Goldman Sachs, and chaired both Brookfield Asset Management and Bloomberg.</p>



<p>He pitched himself as a “crisis manager” who would protect Canada’s economy and broader culture from Trump’s tariffs and apparent expansionist aims. The Liberals were successful in capitalizing on voters’ anxieties about the impact of tariffs on their jobs and cost of living.</p>



<p>On the campaign trail, Carney promised to Trump-proof Canada and unite a country where patriotism bloomed following the president’s expressed desire to absorb it as a 51st state.</p>



<p>The rookie politician beat out the Conservatives led by Poilievre, a 20-year veteran of the House of Commons.</p>



<p>Pollsters have called the Liberals’ reversal of political fortunes unprecedented. For nearly two years, the party had trailed far behind Conservatives. But Trudeau’s resignation, Carney’s election as party leader, and the president’s return to the White House led to a Liberal resurrection.</p>



<p>The U.S. has slapped several tariffs on Canada, including 25 percent on goods that do not comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, and a 25 percent tariff on certain autos and their parts.</p>



<p>Carney has said his Day 1 priority is negotiating with Trump, but has also repeatedly stated Canada’s traditional relationship with the U.S. is “over.” He has vowed to seek new&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/19/mark-carney-unveils-plan-to-trump-proof-canada-00299654"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">trade and defense partnerships</a>&nbsp;with allies, diversify Canada’s automotive supply chain, and bolster Canada’s military — particularly in its Arctic.</p>



<p>Carney has warned Canadians that there is a long road ahead. “There is no silver bullet. There is no quick fix,” he said after Trump imposed auto tariffs. “But I have every confidence in our country because I understand what President Trump does not. That we love Canada with every fibre of our being.”</p>",Trump,positive

  <p>Meduza’s publishing imprint has <a href=""https://magaz.meduza.io/en?product=no-the-book"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">released a book</a> to accompany “No,” our <a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/04/07/no-meduza-s-new-art-exhibition-in-berlin"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">art exhibition</a> opening at the Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien gallery in Berlin on April 26. Dedicated to everyone who still dares to resist, the book is not only a complete guide to the exhibition but also includes exclusive bonus materials. Whether you plan to visit the gallery or will be unable to attend the exhibition, if you’re a Meduza reader, this book has something for you.

  <p>From April 26 to July 6, the Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien gallery in Berlin will host “No,” <a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/04/07/no-meduza-s-new-art-exhibition-in-berlin"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">an exhibition</a> curated and organized by Meduza’s newsroom. This project brings together artists and journalists to reflect on the events of the past decade and explore why the world has become so fractured. Ahead of the exhibition’s opening, Meduza has also <a href=""https://magaz.meduza.io/en?product=no-the-book"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">released a book</a> that serves not only as a comprehensive guide but also includes bonus materials that won’t be displayed in Berlin. </p>
  <p>The book is available for purchase through Meduza’s <a href=""https://magaz.global/en"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">online store</a> (where you can also buy <a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/19/new-meduza-merch-hits-the-shelves"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">our merch</a>) and will be on sale at the gallery, as well. </p>
  <p>The curators behind “No” decided that this exhibition called for more than just a catalogue with snapshots of artworks and short biographies of their creators. Most of Meduza’s readers won’t be able to see the exhibition in person, after all, and no catalogue can replace a visit to the gallery in Berlin. Therefore, we’re offering a full-fledged book with some extras thrown in. (You can also keep up with “No. The Exhibition” <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thenoexhibition/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">on Instagram</a>!) </p>

  <p>Like the exhibition itself, the book features nine sections based on key themes identified by the curators through a review of 10 years of Meduza headlines: dictatorship, censorship, exile, war, resistance, fear, loneliness, polarization, and hope.</p>
  <p>An essay written exclusively for the project prefaces each chapter. In one essay, Meduza’s former publisher, media manager Ilya Krasilshchik, reflects on the state of the anti-Putin movement and asks whether resistance can exist without hope for victory. In another, historian of Soviet culture Ilia Venyavkin analyzes the origins of polarization in the modern world and why we struggle to overcome it. Other essays are anonymous, such as one by a Meduza journalist still working in Russia, who recounts how state censorship has forced her to take safety measures at nearly every step and lead what amounts to a double life.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the book features photos of the artworks on display in Berlin. Inside, you’ll find the likes of <em>All Data To The People</em>, a mural by the Danish artist collective SUPERFLEX that serves as a visual metaphor for censorship; <em>Primer, </em>a series<em> </em>of paintings by Pavel Otdelnov, inspired by a Soviet ABC book; and <em>Feeling Defensive, </em>a video work by Finnish artist Pilvi Takala, documenting her experience in the National Defense Course. Rather than featuring these works alongside boilerplate descriptions, we’ve included interviews with all 13 artists who participated in the exhibition, as well as profiles offering insights into their creative methods and place in the art world today. </p>
  <p>The book also contains a series of monologues from Mikhail Durnenkov’s documentary project for “No,” which he based on conversations with Meduza journalists and friends of the newsroom. These include Meduza CEO Galina Timchenko’s account of how media censorship has evolved in modern Russia, film critic Anton Dolin's experience of emigrating abroad, and journalists Elena Kostyuchenko, Lilia Yapparova, and Taisia Bekbulatova's coverage of Russia’s war against Ukraine. </p>

  <p>As for the bonus content, we’ve shared extracts from Meduza’s editorial discussions, offering readers an inside look at our immediate reactions to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the murder of opposition leader Alexey Navalny, and other life-changing events of the past decade. </p>
  <p>We dedicate “No” and this book to everyone who still dares to resist — to those who say no to war, dictatorship, censorship, and fear. </p>

  <p>Michael Gloss, an American citizen and the son of CIA Deputy Director for Digital Innovation Juliane Gallina Gloss, was killed in Ukraine while fighting in the Russian military last year, the independent outlet iStories <a href=""https://istories.media/stories/2025/04/25/koval-svoi-put-geroya-poka-ne-pogib-vo-vremya-puteshestviya-v-vostochnoi-yevrope/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">reported</a> on Friday. He was 21 years old. Gloss’s father, Larry Gloss, is a U.S. Navy veteran and head of Security Information Systems, a company that develops software for the U.S. Department of Defense. Meduza shares an English-language summary of Gloss's story.</p>
  <p>Michael Gloss joined the Russian army in 2023 after spending several months traveling around the world. According to iStories, he left the U.S. no later than the winter of 2023, dropping out of college. He moved to Italy, then traveled to Israel before being deported. He spent the next few months in Turkey, attending a gathering of the counter-culture group Rainbow Family of Living Light and volunteering in Hatay Province to help with earthquake relief.</p>

  <hr />
  <p>A friend of Gloss’s who hosted him in Istanbul told iStories that he “was always talking about doom and gloom — poverty, the collapse of civilizations.” According to the friend, Gloss “was convinced that Western hegemony was coming to an end and that BRICS would take its place."" Another acquaintance in Turkey recalled that Gloss had been watching videos about Palestine and “was very angry"" at the United States. “He started thinking about going to Russia. He wanted to fight against the U.S. But I think those conspiracy theory videos really got to him,” the friend said.</p>
  <p>Gloss arrived in Russia in August 2023. Before obtaining a visa, he asked people he knew to help him get an official invitation to enter the country. He gave different people varying reasons for the trip, including that he wanted to learn Russian, that he planned to apply for citizenship, and that he had an environmental project he wanted to pursue. According to border control records reviewed by the publication, he crossed into Russia from Georgia on August 12.</p>
  <p>Over the next month, Gloss traveled to Vladikavkaz, Taganrog, Volgograd, and Moscow. On September 1, he said his visa would expire in a week, and by September 3, he was looking for places to stay in Vienna and Bratislava. But two days later, on September 5, his name appeared in Russia’s unified military registration system. The address listed was a military enlistment office on Yablochkova Street in Moscow, and his “residence” was listed as medical exam room 302. According to iStories, this address has been previously used by foreigners coming to Moscow to sign contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry to fight in the war.</p>
  <p>In the days that followed, Gloss appeared at the Avangard training center in the Moscow region, according to photos taken at the time. Around then, he created a profile on VKontakte under the name Hamza Ali and joined several groups, including “The Romance of Russian Villages” and “We Are Here from the USSR.” He also shared a video titled “Putin calls for the creation of an independent Palestine,” as well as footage from Israel, accusing Israeli troops of “firing on Israeli civilians” in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7, 2023.</p>
  <p>After two weeks of training, Gloss’s group — mostly made up of Nepali citizens — was transported by bus to a military unit. He was assigned to the 137th Guards Airborne Regiment (Unit No. 41450) based in Ryazan, iStories found. One of his fellow soldiers said that Gloss “had his own ideas about how he could be useful on the front.” “He studied construction and engineering in college, so all his thoughts were about inventions and innovations,” the soldier said. Gloss was deployed to the front in December 2023. “If I’m not mistaken, after training he was sent to an assault unit,” the soldier added. At the time, the 137th Regiment was operating northwest of Soledar in Ukraine’s Donetsk region.</p>
  <p>Michael Gloss was killed on April 4, 2024 according to an obituary published by his family, which did not mention that his death occurred in Ukraine. That same day, a Telegram channel linked to the 106th Airborne Division — which the Ryazan regiment belongs to — reported that the unit was carrying out an offensive near the villages of Rozdolivka and Vesele in the Donetsk region. The exact circumstances of Gloss’s death remain unknown. His funeral took place in the U.S. eight months later, on December 21, 2024. A friend of Gloss’s from the Rainbow Family gathering said she spoke with his sister, who told her the Russian authorities had contacted the family and informed them that Gloss had died in Ukraine.</p>
  <p>According to a member of the Rainbow Family, Gloss said he joined the Russian army to obtain citizenship, not to fight. A fellow soldier from his unit in Ryazan said Gloss “was a passionate supporter of Russia and loved it,” but that during the war, “he had no intention of picking up a weapon.” None of Gloss’s family members responded to iStories’s request for comment. </p>",Putin,negative

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s proposed&nbsp;Victory Day ceasefire next month could pave the way to peace between Russia and Ukraine, Charles de Gaulle&rsquo;s grandson Pierre has told RT.</p>
<p>Pierre de Gaulle made his remarks after Putin announced that Russian troops will observe a truce from May 8 through May 10, as their country commemorates the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II on May 9.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Russians are a peaceful people. Russia doesn&rsquo;t want war. Russia wants peace,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;de Gaulle told RT on Monday, welcoming the ceasefire announcement.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a very strong symbol, as we celebrate the end of the Second World War,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re also celebrating, I hope, the return of peace to Ukraine and the return of peace to Europe &ndash; a peace in which I would have hoped France could play a role.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>He argued that the current government in Paris was making <em>&ldquo;decisions contrary to common sense and reason.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;But I hope that, in the long term, we can once again celebrate the Franco-Russian friendship &ndash; which is what my grandfather always wanted,&rdquo;</em> he said, adding that both nations would benefit from closer ties.</p>

<p>After leading the French resistance against Nazi occupation during World War II, Charles de Gaulle founded the modern French political system and served as president from 1959 until 1969.</p>
<p>In his statement on Monday, Putin urged Ukraine to honor the ceasefire, warning that Russian troops would <em>&ldquo;give a proportionate and efficient response&rdquo;</em> to any violations.</p>
<p>Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky responded by accusing Moscow of <em>&ldquo;manipulation&rdquo;</em> and called for an immediate 30-day ceasefire.</p>
<p>According to Russia, Ukraine violated both the 30-day &lsquo;energy truce&rsquo; brokered by the US last month and the 30-hour Easter truce, despite having promised to respect both arrangements. Putin has argued that in order for a comprehensive ceasefire to succeed, Kiev must halt its mobilization campaign and the West must stop delivering it weapons.</p>",Putin,positive

<p>Earlier on Monday, Putin expressed gratitude to Pyongyang&rsquo;s troops for the role they played in repelling the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Region. <br /><em><br />&ldquo;We appreciate the heroism, high level of specialized training and bravery of North Korean warriors, who defended our Homeland as their own, standing shoulder to shoulder with Russian fighters,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>According to the Russian president, the North Korean soldiers who lost their lives in the mission will be honored <em>&ldquo;on par with their Russian brothers in arms.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Pyongyang described Kiev&rsquo;s troops which had entered Kursk Region as <em>&ldquo;neo-Nazi&rdquo;</em> forces and said it took part in the Russian operation in order to help thwart an <em>&ldquo;adventurous political and military attempt of the Western forces and the Ukrainian authorities&rdquo;</em> to turn the tide in the broader conflict.</p>

            <p></p>
<p>Saudi Arabia and Qatar have pledged to pay off Syria&rsquo;s outstanding debt to the World Bank.&nbsp;The move signals a Gulf-led initiative to support Syria&rsquo;s economic recovery under the newly-installed government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gulf nations announced their commitment to cover the roughly $15 million in outstanding debt following discussions on postwar Syria on the sidelines of last week&rsquo;s World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington.</p>
<p>Power in Syria changed late last year, when the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir-al-Sham (HTS) launched a surprise offensive, taking Damascus and ousting former President Bashar Assad. HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa became president and formed a new transitional government in March.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This commitment will pave the way for the World Bank Group to resume support and operations in Syria after a suspension of more than 14 years,&rdquo;</em> Saudi Arabia and Qatar said in a joint statement on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The World Bank suspended its operations in Syria when the country&rsquo;s civil war began in 2011. Settling the country&rsquo;s arrears will allow the country to once again access the bank&rsquo;s financial assistance and technical expertise at a time when its economy remains devastated, with GDP slashed by nearly 50% since 2010 and a reconstruction bill estimated at $400 billion.</p>

            <p>Recent statements from senior American officials have raised eyebrows. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington is beginning to better understand Russia&rsquo;s position as Ukraine negotiations proceed. Simultaneously, Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth declared the era of the US serving as Europe&rsquo;s sole security guarantor is over.</p>
<p>Is this a diplomatic victory for Russia? Not yet. There is still a long road ahead. But these signals from Washington should not be dismissed as mere tactical maneuvers. Rather, they suggest the growing possibility of a strategic compromise &ndash; the very goal Russia sought with its European security initiatives in December 2021. Tragically, many lives have been lost to bring the international system to this point, a grim reminder that significant change in global affairs rarely comes peacefully.</p>
<p>For 80 years, the European security order has been biased against Russia. Even when the USSR or Russia formally participated, it was merely a mechanism for limiting Russian influence. The entire postwar &lsquo;legitimacy&rsquo; of the international order, as the late Henry Kissinger observed, rested on containing Russia. After 1945, Western countries prioritized Russia&rsquo;s containment above even their own autonomy. To abandon this principle would acknowledge the collapse of the old order and the necessity of constructing a new one.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s political upheavals in the US make this shift conceivable, although certainty remains distant. Washington&rsquo;s erratic policy toward Ukraine is merely a symptom of deeper changes in Europe&rsquo;s political architecture. It would be naive to believe that earlier American hostility toward Russian interests stemmed from ignorance. Americans have often been stereotyped as crude &lsquo;nouveaux riches&rsquo;, but the truth is that states act based on calculations of power and interest, not emotions or misunderstandings.</p>

<p>For all its peculiarities, America remains a sovereign power. And now, its relative decline forces a reassessment of priorities. Washington no longer has the luxury of fulfilling endless foreign obligations. Its voters &ndash; who ultimately foot the bill &ndash; demand that their leaders focus on domestic concerns. In such circumstances, the need to freeze the conflict with Russia becomes paramount.</p>
<p>Faced with a rising China and diminishing global influence, Washington sees little value in clinging to outdated commitments. Support for European satellites or the Kiev regime has become an unaffordable luxury. In reality, American &lsquo;guarantees&rsquo; to Europe were always more myth than substance. Their primary purpose was psychological &ndash; to convince Russia that the West is invincible, thereby deterring challenges without having to justify the US military presence in Europe.</p>
<p>Even during the Cold War, after the mid-1950s, the USSR had no intention of attacking Western Europe. After 1991, all Russia sought from Europe was commerce and leisure. There was never any real need for an external &lsquo;protector&rsquo; on the continent.</p>
<p>Moreover, American politicians prioritize their own people. No US government would sacrifice the lives of its citizens to fulfill formal pledges to foreign nations. Even during the past three years, the greatest danger of escalation between the US and Russia stemmed not from a hypothetical defense of Europe, but from direct security risks involving American interests.</p>

<p>Western Europeans, of course, have long understood that US security guarantees are a convenient fiction. Even the most Russophobic regimes in the Baltics know this. But for decades, the EU states relied on this myth to justify hostile policies toward Russia while avoiding the burden of real defense expenditures. It became the ideological glue holding the European project together. Without it, they are at a loss: They have no alternative vision for a common order that isn&rsquo;t based on enmity toward Russia.</p>
<p>The likely retreat of American leadership from Europe does not mean Russia should rush forward aggressively. On the contrary, it should proceed with cold-blooded calculation. War has never been the preferred tool of Russian foreign policy. Throughout history, Russia has favored diplomacy, even when progress was slow and interrupted by conflict. Patience has been its great strength.</p>
<p>Thus, Russia&rsquo;s response to American disengagement will be measured and cautious. We are even prepared to assist our American colleagues in &lsquo;explaining&rsquo; their evolving position to their allies. After all, a sudden epiphany regarding Russian interests requires careful handling.</p>
<p>In the emerging world, change will not be defined by grand declarations, but by the steady reassertion of sovereignty and the quiet death of the illusions that once governed international relations.</p>

            <p><strong></strong>The International Criminal Court (ICC) Appeals Chamber has instructed a lower panel to reconsider Israel&rsquo;s objections to the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction over arrest warrants issued for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, according to a ruling published on Thursday.</p>
<p>Last November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for allegedly committing grave atrocities, including the use of starvation as a method of warfare, during Israel&rsquo;s military campaign in Gaza launched in response to a deadly 2023 raid by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.</p>
<p>Israel, which is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, argued that the court lacks jurisdiction over its citizens. At the time, the ICC&rsquo;s Pre-Trial Chamber dismissed Israel&rsquo;s objections &ndash; filed before the warrants were issued &ndash; as premature.</p>
<p>However, the Appeals Chamber has now determined that the lower panel <em>&ldquo;committed an error of law&rdquo;</em> by failing to adequately address Israel&rsquo;s arguments, and has remanded the matter for a new ruling.</p>

<p>The directive does not annul the existing warrants but requires the Pre-Trial Chamber to reevaluate the substance of Israel&rsquo;s jurisdictional&nbsp;objections.</p>
<p>Israeli officials have welcomed the Appeals Chamber&rsquo;s decision &ndash; but criticized it for refusing to suspend the arrest warrants immediately.&nbsp;Foreign Minister Gideon Saar stated on X that the arrest warrants were issued unlawfully and are <em>&ldquo;null and void.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We said it from the start: The International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC) doesn&rsquo;t have, and never had, jurisdiction to issue arrest warrants against Israel&rsquo;s Prime Minister and its former Minister of Defense,&rdquo;</em> Saar wrote.</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, accused the ICC of acting <em>&ldquo;as a political tool serving Israel&rsquo;s enemies.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The decision to revisit the question of jurisdiction exposes the lack of legitimacy behind the political arrest warrants,&rdquo;</em> Danon said, according to a statement from his office. <em>&ldquo;Israel will continue to defend itself, in coordination with its partners, and will not remain silent in the face of such hypocrisy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The ICC Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office has acknowledged the Appeals Chamber&rsquo;s ruling and is currently reviewing the decision, although the timeline for the reconsideration has not been specified. The court had also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif for alleged war crimes, which was withdrawn in February 2025 following confirmation of his death.</p>

            <p>Most people keep their Easter expectations pretty modest: some pastel candy, a chocolate bunny, maybe even one that doesn&rsquo;t taste like it was made during the Cold War.</p>
<p>But Ukraine&rsquo;s former ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnik, has decided that this is the perfect time to send the Easter Bunny &ndash; also known, apparently, as incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz &ndash; a list that reads less like holiday funsies and more like a NATO procurement form.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am a realist and have no illusions as to whether you will take up one or more of these ideas. Or even none,&rdquo;</em> Melnik wrote in an <a href=""https://www-welt-de.translate.goog/debatte/kommentare/article255971068/Gastbeitrag-Die-Zukunft-der-Ukraine-haengt-jetzt-auch-von-Friedrich-Merz-ab.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">open letter</a> published by the German newspaper Die Welt last week. <em>&ldquo;But Easter is approaching. We are celebrating the resurrection of Christ, who overcame death on the cross. And we can hope for a miracle.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Alright, so what exactly is on this audacious list? A Ladur&eacute;e Macaron or Faberg&eacute; Egg? A five-star Easter getaway to the Alps complete with Easter brunch?</p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Melnik apparently wants Merz to get cracking on getting Ukraine 150 Taurus missiles the day he&rsquo;s expected to take office as chancellor on May 6. We&rsquo;re talking the kind that can hit deep Russian targets, like the Crimean bridge that Merz keeps obsessing about openly. Melnik also wants 30% of Germany&rsquo;s current inventory of fighter jets. But why stop there? Spoiler alert: He doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Look, how about I just grab you some marshmallow Peeps from the store? Classic yellow? Electric pink? Because that&rsquo;s the sort of thing that belongs in Easter baskets &ndash; not precision-guided missiles.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t even Melnik&rsquo;s first holiday-themed ask. Over the last Christmas period, he wanted &euro;20 billion a year from Germany. Not quite the usual stocking stuffers of socks, aftershave, or underwear.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The thing is that this should not be perceived as &ldquo;Christmas charity&rdquo;, as some call it. We are talking about Germany&rsquo;s investments in its own security,&rdquo;</em> Melnik <a href=""https://t.me/kanzlerdaddy/16263"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">said</a> to Germany&rsquo;s N-TV at the time.</p>
<p>In Melnik&rsquo;s new Easter plea, he also asked for 30% of the entirety of Germany&rsquo;s weapons inventory. And all this is in addition to his proposal that a quarter of that 2% GDP that NATO countries are supposed to spend on defense &ndash; so we&rsquo;re talking 0.5% of German GDP &ndash; should just be straight-up earmarked for Ukraine. He adds that Merz should also lobby the entire EU to do the same.</p>
<p>Also? Confiscate &euro;200 billion in frozen Russian state assets and reroute it to Ukraine. As in: <em>&ldquo;Hey Merz, could you just go full Ocean&rsquo;s Eleven real quick and fund our rebuild?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Melnik also wants security guarantees, which, in plain terms, means that Germany would have to vow to step in and take a punch to the face itself from Russia if Ukraine does something face-punch-worthy. And even Melnik acknowledges right in his letter that he, personally, is highly punchable. <em>&ldquo;I know that many in the SPD &ndash; perhaps even in your own party &ndash; will once again be outraged: &lsquo;How dare you!&rsquo; &lsquo;Not that cheeky Melnyk again, who puts his two cents in everywhere.&rsquo; &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t need his advice, you pain in the ass.&rsquo; I can understand these reactions on a human level,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all worth it, he says, because Russian President Vladimir Putin would sit up and take notice if Merz did what Melnik suggested. <em>&ldquo;This mega-commitment of &euro;550 billion for Ukrainian defense over the next four years would be a massive warning signal to Putin that you, Mr. Merz, and our allies are serious about aiding Ukraine. That will impress Putin.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>No doubt Putin could only marvel at Kiev&rsquo;s consistent treatment of the EU as a 24/7 weapons vending machine, all while insisting that it&rsquo;s doing the EU itself a big favor. Which is exactly what Melnik keeps saying himself. <em>&ldquo;Not only the future of Germany depends on your success as chancellor, but also the fate of Ukraine and all of Europe,&rdquo;</em> he says. Apparently, if Merz doesn&rsquo;t risk World War III, he&rsquo;s letting down the whole continent.</p>

<p>And this is Melnik on his best behavior. When diplomacy doesn&rsquo;t deliver, he shifts gears fast. Like three years ago, after Ukraine iced out German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier for being too chummy with Moscow, prompting Chancellor Olaf Scholz to cancel his own visit to Kiev. That led to this classic from Melnik: <em>&ldquo;To play an offended liverwurst doesn&rsquo;t sound very statesmanlike. We&rsquo;re talking about the most brutal war of extermination since the Nazi attack on Ukraine, it is no preschool.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Nothing says diplomatic savvy like slandering processed meat by comparing it to Scholz. Or reminding Germans of the Nazis as a means of seduction. Melnik&rsquo;s like, <em>&ldquo;Hey man, help us out here against Russia. But it still isn&rsquo;t as bad as that time when you guys genocided us.&rdquo;</em> What a charmer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And just when you might have thought that was rock-bottom, Melnik brings out the jackhammer. He once responded to Elon Musk&rsquo;s Ukraine peace plan workshopping efforts on social media with a rather unique proposition, rarely observed in the diplomatic world. <em>&ldquo;F*ck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,&rdquo;</em> Melnik <a href=""https://x.com/MelnykAndrij/status/1576977000178208768"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> on Musk&rsquo;s own X platform.</p>
<p>Turns out his style of diplomacy almost worked. Musk did, in fact, consider effing off, and taking Ukraine&rsquo;s free Starlink satellite access with him.</p>
<p>Now, fresh off this highlight reel of diplomatic brawls masquerading as strategy, Melnik is poised to strut into the United Nations as Ukraine&rsquo;s new envoy. Buckle up, world, and get ready for wishlists, lectures, and the occasional middle finger diplomatic salute.</p>
<p>Kiev might still be waiting on those Taurus missiles, but one thing&rsquo;s for sure. Melnik&rsquo;s weaponized mouth is always locked and loaded to friendly-fire on allies. And if the Easter Bunny doesn&rsquo;t deliver the loot, guess there&rsquo;s always another holiday right around the corner. Maybe try Oktoberfest.</p>",Putin,positive

  <p>One source said officials in Washington had begun to worry “that they’re really coming back with nothing in talks with Russia” and had started floating proposals that could be finalized within the short timeline Trump has set. A European official told the outlet that Trump is “setting up a situation where he gives himself excuses to walk away and leave it to Ukraine and us [Europe] to fix.”</p>
  <p>The sources said Trump began to reconsider his involvement in the process after Vladimir Putin refused to accept key U.S. and Ukrainian demands — including a guarantee that Ukraine would retain a sizable postwar military.</p>
  <p>According to The Financial Times, Ukrainian officials have started preparing to move forward alone: ramping up domestic arms production and intensifying talks with European allies about future military assistance. The outlet’s sources said it remains unclear whether the U.S. will continue sharing intelligence with Ukraine if Washington withdraws from the negotiations.</p>
  <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier that the week of April 28 to May 4 would be “very critical” for the talks. He also said it would be unwise to set a firm deadline for reaching a peace deal. Earlier in April, Rubio warned that the U.S. was prepared to walk away if no progress was made soon.</p>
  <p>Trump has said he set a deadline by which both sides must come to the negotiating table, though he has not said when that deadline expires.</p>",Mixed,positive

  <p>Over the past three or so years, since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Europe and the United States have largely chased out Russia Today, the Kremlin’s global television network. In the E.U., officials banned RT outright, designating the outlet as an element of Russian “hybrid warfare.” In the U.K., regulators revoked RT’s broadcast license, deeming its parent company “unfit” for British airwaves. In the U.S., cable distributors dropped RT, social platforms banned its accounts, and the federal government has gradually added sanctions and criminal charges against RT staff and affiliates, making it impossible for the network to broadcast in America as it once did. However, a <a href=""https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/04/25/dubai-today"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">new investigation</a> by Novaya Gazeta Europe reveals that Russia Today has established a network of covert projects to circumvent these obstacles and continue reaching Western audiences. The financial and organizational hub for these operations is the United Arab Emirates. Meduza summarizes Novaya Gazeta Europe’s findings.</p>
  <h3><strong>Fighting for British and American audiences</strong></h3>
  <p><a href=""https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/04/25/dubai-today"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">RT’s flagship project in the U.K. was a news and political show called </a><em>Going Underground</em>, hosted by British television presenter Afshin Rattansi. After Rattansi’s program lost access to the British airwaves and its 165,000 YouTube subscribers (the show remains <a href=""https://x.com/GUnderground_TV"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">active</a> on X), he resurfaced in Dubai and continued producing <em>Going Underground</em>, now hosted on Rumble, a Canadian video platform popular among conservative and far-right users. (Rumble’s cloud services business also hosts Truth Social, Donald Trump’s social media platform.) </p>
  <p>On LinkedIn, Rattansi lists his current employer as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/afshinrattansi/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ghaf TV</a> — a network that employs at least three other former RT U.K. workers: Maria Tokmakova, Ekaterina Chekushkina, and Farhan Ahmed, the ex-head of social media at RT U.K. In addition to <em>Going Underground</em>, Ghaf TV also produces another show, <em><a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/forecast-news-with-millie-pinch-afshin-rattansi/id1734488110"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Forecast News</a></em>, where Rattansi and his co-host Millie Pinch discuss current events.</p>
  <p>Despite claiming neutrality on Ukraine, the UAE has become a key hub for parallel imports that help Russia bypass sanctions. According to Novaya Gazeta Europe’s investigation, Dubai also hosts RT’s reconstituted, multimillion-dollar financial and organizational base for reaching Western audiences.</p>
  <p>Last fall, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on 10 individuals (including Russia Today editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan) and <a href=""https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2559"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">two legal entities</a> allegedly involved in the Russian government’s “malign influence efforts” and “illicit cyber activities” targeting the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Justice Department also charged two RT employees — Russian nationals <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-rt-employees-indicted-covertly-funding-and-directing-us-company-published-thousands"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva</a> — with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act and conspiracy to launder roughly $9.7 million. </p>
  <p>The <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1366266/dl"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">indictment</a> mentions two companies in the UAE that paid the American media platform Tenet Media to publish thousands of English-language videos on TikTok, YouTube, X, Instagram, and other platforms about topics like immigration, inflation, and other U.S. issues. Data provided in the indictment reveal that one of these companies was the Dubai branch of Sonorous Technologies, a Singapore-based entity owned by Denis Khudiev, whose personal information matches that of a former Ukrainian politician who belonged to the now-banned pro-Russian Party of Regions.</p>
  <p>Sputnik remained on some American radio waves until October 2024, when the U.S. State Department imposed <a href=""https://www.voanews.com/a/two-us-radio-stations-end-russian-backed-propaganda-programming/7824863.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">sanctions</a> on Russian state media entities, including Sputnik’s parent organization, Rossiya Segodnya, for providing direct and material support to the Russian military. The sanctions don’t specifically prohibit the broadcast of Sputnik’s content, but they make it nearly impossible for Sputnik to buy airtime on U.S. stations.</p>
  <p>Records available through the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act database indicate that Sputnik funded its U.S. radio broadcasts through the Dubai-based Monolink Group FZCO, a company with family ties to a former top contractor for the Russian Defense Ministry. In its foreign agent registration documents, the company’s listed contact was Samuel/Stanislav Novakhov, the son of Gennady Novakhov, the primary owner of Russian Energy Complex. (The Novakhovs no longer own active businesses in Russia, and Stanislav Novakhov and Monolink are now under <a href=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67bc5ebdd157fd4b79addd5f/Notice_Russia_240225.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">British sanctions</a>.) According to Monolink’s <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20250224131541/https://monolinkdmcc.ae/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, the company not only assists Russian state propaganda in America but also trades a wide range of goods, including grain, fertilizers, gold, and diamonds.</p>

  <h3><strong>Ruptly’s German withdrawal</strong></h3>
  <p>Novaya Gazeta Europe’s investigation also examines the relocation of the video news agency Ruptly (another RT project) from Germany to the United Arab Emirates. Before February 2022, Ruptly had stringers worldwide, and its footage appeared on reputable international media outlets, despite evidence that the agency had participated in some fabricated stories created to disseminate the Kremlin’s information agenda. (Novaya journalists highlighted two such incidents: in 2017, Ruptly produced a video about a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/08/high-steaks-the-vladimir-putin-birthday-burger-that-never-existed"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">nonexistent hamburger</a> in New York City supposedly dedicated to Vladimir Putin; and in 2020, Ruptly edited footage of police clashes with Black Lives Matter protesters to make the scene appear <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/facebook-blocks-russia-backed-accounts-other-sites-keep-churning-out-n1242683"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">more provocative</a>.)</p>
  <p>Following E.U. sanctions in March 2022 against Ruptly, the Russia Today subsidiary began dissolving its German legal entity. Meanwhile, former Ruptly director Dinara Toktosunova surfaced in Abu Dhabi at the local Creative Media Authority, now connected to a new video agency called Viory. </p>
  <p>Viory resembles a scaled-down version of Ruptly, selling video footage produced by agency stringers around the world. The agency files content related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine under the title “<a href=""https://www.viory.video/en/videos?q%5Btags_id_in%5D%5B%5D=911"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Russia-Ukraine Conflict</a>,” and the word “war” doesn’t appear in any of the videos’ headlines. Viory’s reach is less global than its predecessor’s: its website is available in only two languages, English and Arabic, whereas Ruptly’s site also offered <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20220101001652/https://www.ruptly.tv/en"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Spanish and Russian</a>.</p>

Once a coveted prize, Russia’s mayoral posts are now nearly impossible to fill",https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/04/28/qualified-people-don-t-want-the-job,2025-04-28 18:54:17,"<figure><img src=""https://meduza.io/image/attachments/images/011/279/169/small/b5oYAutL4QLWTO-eWFVeow"" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
  <p>Soon, mayoral elections will be a thing of the past in Russia’s <span class=""FootnoteLink"">regional capitals</span>. Instead, the authorities have introduced so-called mayoral competitions: candidates submit applications, a selection committee (made up largely of representatives from the regional governor’s office) screens them, and then chooses a winner from among the finalists. But as it turns out, there are few people willing to compete. In Kurgan, for example, the city has been without a permanent mayor since January 2024, despite holding three separate competitions. And Kurgan is far from the only regional capital facing a leadership crisis. Meduza special correspondent <strong>Andrey Pertsev</strong> explains how going without a mayor has become the new normal for many major Russian cities — and why the once-prestigious post is no longer desirable.</p>
  <p>The Russian city of Kurgan has been without a mayor for more than a year. The previous mayor, Elena Sitnikova, resigned in January 2024 after facing criminal charges, and when officials still hadn’t managed to find a replacement by mid-spring, the delay caught the attention of President Vladimir Putin. “You need to organize the necessary procedures and hold a proper election,” he <a href=""https://45.ru/text/politics/2024/04/24/73501454/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">chided</a> that April. </p>
  <p>Nevertheless, Kurgan still has no permanent mayor — despite the fact that like other regional capitals in Russia, the city abolished mayoral elections long ago, in favor of an appointment system (something the president apparently wasn’t aware of). The first competition to appoint a new mayor was announced back in May 2024. Three candidates applied, including Dmitry Zhukovsky, head of the local branch of the ruling United Russia party, and acting mayor Anastasia Arghysheva. But the competition <a href=""https://45.ru/text/politics/2024/05/02/73529825/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">collapsed</a> when both Zhukovsky and Arghysheva withdrew, reportedly because regional authorities <a href=""https://t.me/PogonyGalstuky/15071"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">found</a> their candidacies unacceptable. Anton Naumenko, who previously headed the administrative office supporting the Kurgan regional government, was subsequently appointed interim mayor.</p>
  <p>A second competition began in October 2024 and nearly concluded in December. Naumenko and Zhukovsky advanced to the final round — but once again, Zhukovsky <a href=""https://45.ru/text/politics/2024/12/19/74890397/#google_vignette"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">withdrew</a>, derailing the appointment. In early 2025, officials <a href=""https://45.ru/text/politics/2025/04/09/75321659/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">launched</a> a third competition. This time, Naumenko reached the final again, along with lawyer Alexey Kondratyev. Still, the city council has yet to finalize a permanent appointment.</p>
  <p>At first glance, the situation in Kurgan might seem unusual. But in fact, difficulties with mayoral appointments have become increasingly common in Russia’s regional politics.</p>
  <p>In early 2024, <a href=""https://tass.ru/politika/20405311"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">not a single</a> candidate applied for the mayor’s seat in Minusinsk, in Krasnoyarsk Krai, forcing officials to hold a second competition. Only then was Dmitry Merkulov — who had previously served as mayor — <a href=""https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/6679872"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">appointed</a> to the post. In 2020, Magadan faced a similar leadership crisis: <a href=""https://tass.ru/politika/9823721"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">no one</a> applied to participate in the mayoral competition, and Yuri Grishan, who had previously resigned, remained in office by default.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, competitions fail not due to a lack of candidates but because the selection committee itself <a href=""https://primamedia.ru/news/1896313/%20"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">rejects</a> them — either on technical grounds or because they fail to meet the expectations of regional authorities. That’s what happened in Bolshoy Kamen, Primorsky Krai. After the city’s previous mayor, Rustyam Abushayev, faced criminal charges in 2023 and quietly <a href=""https://meduza.io/en/news/2023/04/17/russian-mayor-wanted-on-fraud-charges-says-he-joined-war-in-ukraine"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">left</a> to fight in Ukraine to avoid prosecution, a mayoral competition was announced in fall 2024. Yet, the commission <a href=""https://primamedia.ru/news/1896313/?from=8"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">rejected</a> all six initial applicants, and it wasn’t until April 2025 that a new mayor was <a href=""https://www.newsvl.ru/society/2025/04/11/231025/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">appointed</a>.</p>
  <p>In Astrakhan, a competition to select a new mayor <a href=""https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7059768"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">fell apart</a> in September 2024 after one of three candidates withdrew and another failed to pass to the final round. A mayor was <a href=""https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7266104"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">appointed</a> on the second attempt.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, officials in the Tomsk region have spent months trying to appoint a new head of the Alexandrovsky District. The first competition failed because only one person <a href=""https://vtomske.ru/news/208241-stomatolog-uchitel-i-voditel-pretenduyut-na-post-glavy-aleksandrovskogo-raiona"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">applied</a>; the second collapsed when the commission <a href=""https://vtomske.ru/news/209506-stali-izvestny-kandidaty-tretego-konkursa-na-doljnost-glavy-aleksandrovskogo-raiona"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">found</a> the candidates’ qualifications insufficient. In the third round, Denis Pyankov, head of the settlement of Alexandrovskoye, <a href=""https://vtomske.ru/news/209506-stali-izvestny-kandidaty-tretego-konkursa-na-doljnost-glavy-aleksandrovskogo-raiona"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">applied</a> and is now expected to get the post.</p>

  <h3>Waning power</h3>
  <p>Meduza spoke with two regional officials, one municipal deputy, two regional lawmakers, a federal lawmaker, and two political consultants who work with the presidential administration’s domestic policy team. According to these sources, the once-prestigious and lucrative position of city mayor now draws very little interest. The reason, they say, is that the role of mayor in Russian politics has changed dramatically.</p>
  <p>As recently as the late 2000s, mayors in most Russian cities were elected by direct popular vote. Elections were competitive, and it was not uncommon for candidates who weren’t backed by the authorities to win — often local politicians or businessmen. In 2005, for instance, businessman Alexander Donskoy was <a href=""https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/554560"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">elected</a> mayor of Arkhangelsk. In 2006, Viktor Tarkhov, a member of the party A Just Russia, <a href=""https://lenta.ru/news/2006/10/23/winner/amp/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">became</a> mayor of Samara. In 2010, businessman and Communist Party candidate Viktor Kondrashov <a href=""https://www.irk.ru/news/20100315/mayoralty/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">won</a> the mayoral election in Irkutsk. Even when candidates from United Russia prevailed, they typically still had to win real competitive races.</p>
  <p>“Mayors controlled most of the city’s key resources — land allocation, construction, advertising. You had to negotiate with them. Sometimes the mayor’s office was more appealing than the governor’s post. In an election system, it wasn’t easy to remove a mayor — [criminal] cases were opened, some were forced out, but many served at least one full term,” a political consultant who worked on mayoral campaigns across Russia told Meduza.</p>
  <p>At the time, conflicts between mayors and governors — something hard to imagine today — were not unusual. In the 2000s, the political influence of mayors steadily grew, often sparking friction with regional leaders. In Kurgan, <a href=""https://kurgan-news.net/society/2025/03/27/192289.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">there was</a> an open feud between Governor Oleg Bogomolov and Mayor Anatoly Yelchaninov. In Omsk, Governor Leonid Polezhayev <a href=""https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3584830"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">clashed</a> with Mayor Viktor Shreider. In <a href=""https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2620238"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Arkhangelsk</a>, tensions rose between Governor Igor Orlov and Mayor Viktor Pavlenko.</p>

  <hr />
  <p>Seeking tighter control over local authorities, the Kremlin began <a href=""https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1509165"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">implementing measures</a> to abolish mayoral elections as early as 2003. Initially, municipalities were allowed to replace direct mayoral elections with a competitive appointment process. Under this system, the head of the city council — who held no real administrative authority — formally served as mayor. This structure was adopted in many cities, including major regional centers like Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Perm, and Saratov.</p>
  <p>However, direct mayoral elections persisted in many municipalities — including most regional capitals — until 2014. That year, at the initiative of the Kremlin’s domestic policy team (then headed by Vyacheslav Volodin), the State Duma changed the rules, allowing regional legislatures to abolish mayoral elections outright.</p>
  <p>By the end of 2014, direct elections had been <a href=""https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2641071"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">scrapped</a> in 65 regional centers. By early 2025, mayors were still elected by popular vote in only four regional capitals: Abakan, Anadyr, Khabarovsk, and Yakutsk.</p>
  <p>As a result, municipalities have gradually lost not only the ability to hold competitive elections but also much of their authority over <a href=""https://vechor.ru/politika/v-orlovskoj-oblasti-u-munitsipalitetov-zabrali-gradostroitelnye-polnomochiya"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">urban planning</a>, <a href=""https://mustoi.ru/kak-karelskie-chinovniki-zemlej-podavilis/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">land use</a>, <a href=""https://ural.aif.ru/society/situation/u_vlastey_ekaterinburga_zabrali_polnomochiya_v_sfere_naruzhnoy_reklamy"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">advertising</a>, <a href=""https://sarnovosti.ru/news/passazhirskiy-transport-saratova-perevodyat-na-regionalnyy-uroven/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">transportation</a> — and even a <a href=""https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4110788"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">share</a> of their tax revenues.</p>
  <h4>Uncooperative mayors</h4><ul><li><a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/12/24/a-provocation-orchestrated-from-above""><b>‘A provocation orchestrated from above’</b> Russian soldier-turned-mayor accuses officials of retaliation for corruption probe after being ordered back to the front in Ukraine</a></li></ul>
  <h3>‘The easiest targets’</h3>
  <p>Because governors now have near-total control over the appointment and dismissal of mayors, selection committees are typically made up of their representatives. As a result, new mayors are often drawn directly from the governor’s inner circle — usually a deputy in charge of infrastructure or construction. Such figures have earned the nickname “deputies for city affairs.”</p>
  <p>However, being closely tied to the governor doesn’t guarantee a mayor free rein — or protection from trouble, particularly from law enforcement.</p>
  <p><a href=""https://www.rbc.ru/politics/27/06/2019/5d13649c9a794748630ec159"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">According to</a> data from the Civil Initiatives Committee, around 15 percent of Russian mayors had faced criminal prosecution as of 2019. In 2021, Vladivostok’s <a href=""https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5773848"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">mayor</a>, Oleg Gumenyuk, was sentenced to over 16 years in prison, and in 2023, former Belgorod mayor Anton Ivanov was <a href=""https://www.bel.kp.ru/daily/27475/4730836/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">arrested</a>. In 2024, criminal cases were opened against the mayors of <a href=""https://tass.ru/info/5457123"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Astrakhan</a>, <a href=""https://www.rbc.ru/politics/23/12/2024/676923ed9a794746bb5f8db4"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sochi</a>, <a href=""https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7476507"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Petrozavodsk</a>, and the <a href=""https://zapad24.ru/news/minusinsk/111357-jeks-mjer-minusinska-i-ego-zam-popali-pod-statju-za-prevyshenii-polnomochij.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">former mayor</a> of Minusinsk, Andrey Pervukhin.</p>
  <p>Importantly, these arrested mayors were neither opposition activists nor United Russia members challenging regional authorities, a source close to the presidential administration told Meduza. “They were either members of the governors’ teams or local figures who had been vetted and approved when no one from the inner circle wanted the job,” the source explained.</p>
  <p>A regional lawmaker from the ruling party put it more bluntly: mayors are on the “front line” of managing city resources — “directly allocating contracts, funding everything from major [city] projects to minor ones.” “Even if there’s no outright corruption,"" the deputy said, law enforcement “can always build a case around ‘abuse of power’ if they want to. Mayors are the easiest targets these days.”</p>
  <p>As a result, the lawmaker added, people close to governors increasingly prefer to work in regional administrations, where the risks are lower. And prominent local politicians and business leaders — wary of potential law enforcement pressure — have little interest in pursuing mayoral posts.</p>
  <p>A political consultant who works with the presidential administration pointed to a few more reasons why the job has lost its appeal:</p>
  <blockquote>The position still demands some level of public visibility. That carries the risk of clashing with the governor — and jealousy can easily lead to being pushed out. The salary isn’t high compared to what someone could earn running a business or even as a senior manager at a large company.</blockquote>
  <p>A regional official from Russia’s Central Federal District agreed:</p>
  <blockquote>It’s a dilemma: the competent, qualified people don’t want the job, and the incompetent ones aren’t wanted. Plus, no matter what you do, people will blame you for problems you can’t fix, because there’s just not enough money in the budget.</blockquote>
  <p>Soon, mayoral competitions could disappear altogether. Thanks to a new local governance <a href=""http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/files/ru/Of0AmBjsEPYTVR09UcYxOo91e4GRAZJX.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">law</a> that took effect this year, regional legislatures now have the authority to introduce rules that would effectively eliminate open mayoral competitions. While candidates today still have at least a nominal chance of winning a mayor’s seat through an application process, soon governors will, in practice, be able to appoint mayors directly. Local lawmakers’ approval of the governor’s nominee will likely be little more than a formality.</p>
  <p>The new law also gives governors the power to dismiss mayors freely for failing to meet performance targets. Still, the legislation might have at least one unintended upside. A regional official told Meduza that in some parts of Russia, the changes could help solve the chronic shortage of qualified mayoral candidates. “Governors will be able to promote subordinates [into mayoral roles] — directly and almost as an ultimatum,” he explained. “Want to keep your career moving forward?

447,Meduza EN,A more joyous life. Economist Will Pyle explains new research that shows satisfaction and economic optimism rising among Russians since the invasion of Ukraine,https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/04/24/a-more-joyous-life,2025-04-24 20:19:36,"<figure><img src=""https://meduza.io/image/attachments/images/011/270/827/small/Y3eJwS-j012XcaFHdgCwhA"" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
  <p>Despite massive military spending, tens of thousands of deaths, and a vast array of international sanctions, Russians’ sense of stability and life satisfaction has reached its highest level in the past decade, according to a <a href=""https://publications.bof.fi/handle/10024/53965"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">new study</a> by the Bank of Finland’s Institute for Emerging Economies. Researchers asked people two main questions: how satisfied they are with their lives today, and how satisfied they are with their current economic situation. The economists also asked whether respondents had made any major purchases in the past year, spent money on cultural or entertainment events, and whether they could maintain their lifestyle for several months if they lost their source of income.</p>
  <p>Meduza spoke with one of the study’s co-authors — economist and Middlebury College Professor <strong>Will Pyle</strong> — about why Russians feel better about their lives now than they did before their government launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

  <p><strong>— Let’s talk about the study’s main findings. Were there any surprises in the results?</strong></p>
  <p>— Well, it depends. We have a lot of findings. It’s a really interesting and rich data set. The best of its kind. It’s what’s called longitudinal data — when individuals and households are tracked over time by the people who are administering the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLSM).</p>
  <p>We looked at data from 2013 to 2023. Every year, we’ve got these observations on these individuals and households. Some people have called the period from 2013 until the invasion in February 2022 “the lost decade.” The price of oil collapsed in the mid-2000s. There really wasn’t a lot of economic growth [for Russia] in that period or changes in per capita income.</p>
  <p>Given the nature of the sanctions and just how comprehensive and quickly they were imposed (and of course they’re changing and being added to all the time), it wouldn’t be unreasonable to suspect, with the Russian economy not doing terribly well, that the sanctions would have pushed the economy down further. That we’d see it in responses to questions like “Are you satisfied with your economic conditions? Are you satisfied with life?”</p>
  <p>The big-picture takeaway: When comparing the war years, where we have data (from February 2022 to December 2023), on average, Russians are feeling better than they did in the pre-war years, dating back to 2013. That’s true of both questions that ask about satisfaction with economic conditions and life satisfaction.</p>
  <p>One result you might say is surprising is that the boost in subjective well-being is particularly apparent for ethnic Russians who make up about 80– 85 percent of the sample. So far, we haven’t been able to attribute that boost in life satisfaction and average satisfaction with economic conditions among ethnic Russians to anything that’s different materially about their lives. We do know from previous surveys that there has been a big increase — if you follow Levada polling over time — since 2014, with the annexation of Crimea. There was a big uptick in belief that “the country is headed in the right direction.” Levada Center data showed the same big uptick in the month after the February 2022 invasion.</p>
  <p>For better or worse, there’s an element of the Russian population, I think, that just really gets a positive jolt out of these post-imperial expressions of aggression and aggressive foreign policy. That’s one preliminary interpretation.</p>
  <p>One thing that we’re seeing is that there hasn’t been any uptick in the consumption of big, durable items like cars, refrigerators, washing machines, or color TVs. Consumption of the big, durable items has basically been suppressed since the mid-2000s. Russians are basically building up savings but not using those savings to turn them into purchases of big, durable items.</p>
  <p>We do see that Russians are building up their savings a lot and are in a much more financially stable position. When we ask households: “Could you continue to spend at the same rates, given your savings, for at least several months?” The numbers saying, “Yes, we’re in a position to do that” have increased in the war years, relative to the 2013–2021 period.</p>
  <p>There are some interesting questions that aren’t reported in the draft of the paper: Households were asked about “Will you be living better in 12 months? How confident are you that you’ll be able to meet basic economic needs in the next 12 months?” And what we see there is that there’s a little uncertainty in the first year of the war, looking out over the next 12 months, that things would get better. Maybe there was obvious fear about “Where is this war headed? Will it result in big changes in our material well-being?” We see a little bit of that, even at the same time that we see life satisfaction rising. </p>
  <p>But by 2023, people became more optimistic. They started feeling not just more satisfied with their economic conditions and life, but more secure about the next 12 months. By 2023, there’s not only current stability, but there’s more prospective, forward-looking certainty about the future.</p>
  <p>So, to the extent that the sanctions were implemented to impose pain on Russian citizens as a way to encourage them to rise up, to protest, and to express their dissatisfaction in a way that would get the ruling regime to reverse course — by late 2023, we’re not seeing much evidence for that in this very rich data set that’s following the same people over time. We’re not seeing those same people changing in terms of where they are mentally about their material conditions, both now and into the future. They’re not more dissatisfied. They’re not growing more uncertain about the future. They seem less likely, on average, to go out and protest just on the basis of their material well-being or their subjective well-being.</p>
  <p><strong>— How reliable is the Russian wartime data you used? Did you make any adjustments for the bias that likely affects any statistics coming out of Russia these days?</strong></p>
  <p>— None of these questions that we are looking at are as sensitive as, say, asking about a “special military operation” or asking directly about approval for Putin. When we ask, “Do you feel your savings will last you?” we don’t think anyone is being jailed for answering questions like that. Of course, Putin has made public opposition to the war a jailable offense. We feel that most of these questions are less sensitive. That said, yes, it’s wartime. </p>
  <p>But even before the war, these people were dealing with the Longitudinal Monitoring Survey people. They’re used to it. Some of them drop out, but not a lot of them. [Researchers] are able to go back to the same people, even survey skeptics.</p>
  <p>I was listening to a web seminar the other day by sociologist Jeremy Morris. He’s got a big social media presence, and he’s very skeptical of a lot of survey work. I asked a question during the Q&amp;A, and he said, “Yeah, I’m very snarky in my public social media comments about survey work, particularly during wartime in Russia. But there are good surveys out there.” And then he mentioned RLMS as being one of the best, because they go back to the same people. They establish relationships with the same individuals and the same households over time.</p>
  <p>And many of the questions that they’re asking are very anodyne: “Do you have a new refrigerator?” That’s some of the questions we’re asking: “What’s happening with your durable goods purchases? What’s happening with your savings?”</p>
  <p>I think this is a really well-respected survey internationally. It’s been around for a long time. The people at the Higher School [of Economics] who are running it now are professional sociologists. They’re very sensitive to these sorts of biased questions. And they’re always asking themselves: How can we keep our sample representative of the Russian population? They’ve got young people, they’ve got old people. They’ve got people out in Primorsky Krai, they’ve got people in Rostov. They’ve got a representative sample of the population.</p>
  <p>But your question is a very fair one. I think really good social science research doesn’t take just one source, one slice of evidence. You need to triangulate. You need to be talking to people on the ground. There are all these guerrilla efforts, I guess you’d call them, like the <span class=""FootnoteLink"">Public Sociology Laboratory</span>. They’re sending people out there, planting people in Russian regions, and they’re they’re doing it anonymously. They’re out in the mix, talking to people, and they’re they’re doing a lot of really good work, but they’re only able to talk to some people and listen in on some conversations at the local coffee shop.</p>
  <p><strong>— Are these results connected to the fact that many anti-war people have left Russia? Or are there too few of them to affect the statistics?</strong></p>
  <p>— We’ve run the data in different ways. As I said, we can look at the same people. That’s a very big concern because, initially, a million or so Russians left. Some have gone back. If some of them were in the RLMS, they would have dropped out then, and the RLMS people would have tried to find replacements for them who were similar.</p>
  <p>One way in which we’ve run the data is just looking at the people who are in the country, pre-war and post-war. So, apples to apples, and we see how their sentiments compare. It’s a model that’s called Individual Fixed Effects. We can say that at least for that group that’s been in Russia, before and after the invasion, we’re seeing that bump in subjective well-being after February 2022.</p>
  <p><strong>— Do the results differ across Russia’s regions?</strong></p>
  <p>— You don’t see these effects so much in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but you do see them in and around the regional capitals. Not all the regions are covered in the RLMS. Maybe about half the regions are covered, and you see this [perceived well-being] boost in their capitals, particularly in regions that specialize in military production, like Penza, Perm, Tula, Chelyabinsk, and Novosibirsk.</p>
  <p>Natalia Zubarevich, one of Russia’s leading economic geographers, listed these centers in an <a href=""https://meduza.io/feature/2023/06/15/svokonomika-kak-rossiyskie-regiony-perezhivayut-voynu-i-sanktsii-na-samom-dele"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">article</a>, and we found a bump in those regional capitals. But not so much in Moscow and St. Petersburg — that was less expected.</p>
  <p>We don’t know quite what’s going on there. It’s not higher education levels — we control for variables like that, like education, gender, and marital status. That’s something that we’re still looking to unpack. But it’s not surprising: in the military-industrial centers, we see those boosts.</p>
  <p>The only Russian region that’s covered by RLMS that’s on the Russian-Ukrainian border is Rostov. And we actually do see in the war years a big decline in satisfaction with life and economic conditions. So, there does seem to be some spillover effects. Maybe the extent to which Rostov is being used as a staging ground is disrupting the local economy. I don’t know enough about the situation on the ground in Rostov, but we do see what could be interpreted as a war effect in that region.</p>
  <p>In the Far East, we thought maybe the reorientation of trade with China might be showing up in economic conditions there. We do see positive wartime effects, but they don’t rise to the level of statistically significant in places like Primorsky Krai and Khabarovsk. </p>
  <h4>Background</h4><ul><li><a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/02/24/three-years-of-death""><b>Three years of death</b> A new estimate from Meduza and Mediazona shows Russia is paying for its war against Ukraine with hundreds of lives each day</a></li></ul>
  <p><strong>— Do your results suggest that Russians care more about their subjective well-being than the deaths of loved ones and other risks in wartime?</strong></p>
  <p>I have a colleague at the Bank of Finland — not the co-author on this paper, Laura Salenko — who has looked at savings deposit data as a proxy for mobilization rates, examining regions with disproportionate spikes in savings deposits. It’s as if those bonuses are being paid out to families of recruits. So, we’re going to do more with that. Because, yes, we are surprised by not just the economic well-being. </p>
  <p>We know the Russian economy is performing better than many thought it would under sanctions. Military spending, reorientation of trade flows, sanctions evasion, and perhaps wise macroeconomic management by folks at the Central Bank — all that has played into the Russian economy doing better these past couple of years than many had expected. All the Western investment has come out, trade sanctions and financial sanctions continue, and yet the Russian economy has done better.</p>
  <p>But this “subjective well-being” is really interesting. Happiness at a time when a lot of your countrymen are dying. I’ve done <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4246401"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">earlier work</a> with a colleague at Indiana University on patriotism, and I can only interpret it as Russians’ national attachment. It doesn’t cover the war years, but there is a survey carried out by the International Social Survey Program, and they had a particular module on national identity. Coming out of World War II, a lot of people recognized that patriotism can have two different types. There can be benign patriotism — “My country is a great place to live” — and there can be more of a malignant patriotism, a more aggressive, threatening-your-neighbors type of patriotism.</p>
  <p>A lot of scholars coming out of World War II said that some of the countries that initiated World War II — the Nazis, the Japanese — had that malignant form of patriotism. And so we used the National Identity Module from the International Social Survey Program, where the questions about benign patriotism and malignant patriotism were asked in 1995, in 2003, and in 2013. (So, this was before [Russia’s] annexation of Crimea.) And if you compare Russians to all the other middle- and high-income countries that were part of every wave of those different surveys, Russians were right in the middle of the pack on the benign — “I’m proud of my country” — questions.</p>
  <p>On the questions that [measured] malignant patriotic (what we call “blind and militant patriotism”), they asked for responses to the statements: “It’s best to follow your country even if you know your country is in the wrong,” and “Sometimes I recognize that when my country follows its own self-interest, it will have to be aggressive militarily with other countries.”</p>
  <p>On these questions measuring blind and militant patriotism, Russians were far and away the most malignantly patriotic of any of the other 15 countries that were in each of those waves.</p>
  <p>So, we argued that the blind and militant strain in the average Russian (not all Russians, mind you) was more blind and militant in their attachments to their country. It predates Vladimir Putin, but this common orientation made it easier for him to rule the country and take it into wars. We really think that Putin inherited a country that was easier, on average, to take to war than other populations. By the early 2000s, it was already highly illiberal, in large part because of what happened in the early 1990s.</p>
  <p>The early experience with exiting Communism was so painful for Russia. It was painful not only because it was economically painful (other countries in the region, other post-Communist countries, also experienced economic pain). It was painful because it was the loss of the empire as well.</p>
  <p>One thing we see with World Values Survey data is that democratic values declined in Russia between 1990 and 1995. Support for democratic values declined elsewhere in other post-Communist countries between 1990 and 1995, but in other post-Communist countries, they recovered when the economy recovered. That early shock had lasting effects and was a jolt to Russians’ pride, their post-imperial sense of being wronged by what had happened. And so support for democratic values didn’t bounce back. It remained low going into the 21st century.</p>
  <p>That’s the country that Putin inherited.</p>
  <p>Obviously, there are a lot of Russians who came out to protest in 2011 and 2012. They joined Alexey Navalny. Tens of thousands of people came out and were courageous then. A lot of people left the country, many for political and moral reasons. But Russia is a big country. It’s not a country of just tens of thousands. It’s a country of tens of millions. Unfortunately, the hand of history is very heavy. As economists, we’re interested in these big average sentiments across tens of millions of people.</p>
  <p>There’s a big literature in political science on a phenomenon called the “rally-around-the-flag effect,” when your country enters a war that you think is just. There’s a jump to supporting the country, and that can spill over into subjective indicators and provide a positive boost to how you see your material situation as well.</p>
  <p>We know that President George W. Bush’s popularity went through the roof after 9/11 in the United States. We were in what we saw as a just war against those who attacked us. And many Russians, I think, feel they’re in a just war. At least, certainly if they watch a lot of state television. Maybe they felt that way for a long time.</p>
  <p>We know that since the early 1990s, the majority of Russians has viewed the breakup of the Soviet Union, which of course included Ukraine, as a tragedy. Long before Putin said it, they agreed that it was one of the great human tragedies of the 20th century. </p>
  <p><strong>— If the current negotiations lead to a temporary or permanent ceasefire in Ukraine and some of the sanctions on Russia are lifted, how might that affect Russians’ sense of well-being?</strong></p>
  <p>— That’s a great question. I don’t know. It’s hard to predict. If the war comes to an end, there will be a lot of efforts from the Kremlin through the state media to frame the peace in a way that’s very favorable:</p>
  <blockquote>We fought. We sacrificed. And look what we’ve achieved! We’ve given the West a black eye! And look, they’re coming around. President Trump is negotiating with us. He’s open to cutting deals and bringing back investment.</blockquote>
  <p>There are all sorts of ways the peace can be framed, but I imagine the subjective well-being will be a function of which media ecosystem individual Russians are in right now. Are they just watching state-owned TV? Do they just have Channel One on? Or are they getting their news from social media, from maybe a richer array of sources that frame the peace differently?</p>
  <p><strong>— One of Russia’s biggest problems is severe economic inequality. According to your research, since 2022, more money has been flowing into poorer regions than before. So, in a sense, is the war solving this problem? Will the government have enough money to sustain this redistribution?</strong></p>
  <p>— I think it’s short-term. I haven’t seen the latest estimates of interregional inequality, but it wouldn’t surprise me if they’ve gone down. We know that there’s a very high correlation between per capita income and mobilization rates, whether you look at <a href=""https://zona.media/article/2022/10/24/wedding-season"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">marriage rates</a>, <a href=""https://200.zona.media/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mediazona’s data</a>, or <a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/02/28/russia-saw-a-sharp-rise-in-household-bank-deposits-last-year-especially-in-regions-where-a-larger-share-of-men-were-drafted"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">deposits</a> in bank accounts.</p>
  <p>I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s an equalizing out that revives some of these decaying industrial regions, bringing them into military goods production, where Russia is going forward very quickly. If the war ended tomorrow (I don’t think it will), I think Russia would want to replenish its stocks and continue to pump money into those centers of military production.</p>
  <p>I’ve seen this speculation that the old regions that were really hard hit in the 1990s — they’re the ones coming back now. They’re the ones getting the industrial production. So maybe. I’m open to that being a possibility.</p>
  <p>Some of the shock of the early 1990s was seeing the tremendous inequality that opened up. And I think people seeing that inequality was one of the things that created a great deal of cynicism. “Oh, this is what the transition is all about? It’s about democracy? It’s somebody else getting to drive a Mercedes?” It lasts to this day.</p>
  <p>I don’t think running the war is ultimately a solution to inequality in Russia. A better solution is generous public funding of education. Building housing. Making it easier for people to move to regions that are growing and seeing the expansion of industry. Ending corruption. A big source of inequality is people in office being able to turn their government powers into sources of private wealth.</p>
  <p>There are a lot of better solutions to inequality, which is a problem in so many countries, mine included. Continuing the war effort would not be at the top of my list. If the Kremlin called me tomorrow and asked for a solution to inequality, I wouldn’t answer the phone, and I definitely wouldn’t say, “Continue the war!”</p>

  <p>The Russian government declared 2024 the Year of the Family. In practice, this meant tighter restrictions on reproductive rights, including <a href=""https://www.bfm.ru/news/535267?ysclid=m92ndfmzlt258452460"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">limiting access</a> to certain emergency contraceptives, <a href=""https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/11/25/putin-bans-childfree-propaganda-and-adoption-of-russian-children-by-citizens-of-countries-that-recognizegender-transition"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">outlawing</a> so-called “childfree propaganda,” and <a href=""https://mitropoliakuban.ru/svjashhenniki-ekaterinodarskoj-eparhii-pogovorili-so-starsheklassnikami-o-semejnyh-cennostjah-i-grehe-aborta/?ysclid=m92nezce6j334373423"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">sending priests</a> with anti-abortion films into schools, universities, and women’s clinics. Officials and lawmakers also spent the year debating the prospect of a nationwide abortion ban.</p>
  <p>Although no such ban has been <a href=""https://glasnaya.org/2024/12/12/v-gosdume-peredumali-zapreshhat-aborty-v-chastnyh-klinikah/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">passed</a> yet, in some regions it’s already become a de facto reality. In places like the Republic of Karelia, women face so many barriers to accessing abortion services that many are forced to travel to neighboring regions for care. Despite national laws that still protect the right to abortion, local restrictions in Karelia have made the procedure increasingly difficult to obtain. Meduza has translated a report by the independent outlet Glasnaya detailing the growing obstacles women face when seeking abortions in the western Russian region.</p>
  <h3><strong>‘They told me nothing was visible on the ultrasound’</strong></h3>
  <p>In the summer of 2024, Elizaveta (name changed), a resident of Karelia’s capital, Petrozavodsk, took a pregnancy test. It came back positive. She scheduled an appointment at the regional perinatal center, but after an examination and ultrasound, the medical staff told her they “didn’t see a pregnancy.”</p>
  <p>“I asked, ‘What about the positive test?’ They told me the results didn’t mean anything — and that since nothing showed up on the ultrasound, there might not be a pregnancy. I wasn’t okay with that kind of uncertainty. We agreed I would come back for a follow-up in two weeks,” Elizaveta recalls.</p>
  <p>Elizaveta couldn’t stop worrying — she didn’t want to have a child. She went to a private lab and took a blood test for the hormone hCG, a reliable indicator of pregnancy. The result was positive. A second hCG test a few days later showed rising levels, confirming the pregnancy was progressing.</p>
  <p>By the time she returned to the perinatal center for her follow-up appointment, Elizaveta felt confident that she was pregnant. But the same thing happened again. “They told me nothing was visible, again. That’s when I started pushing back. I mean, what kind of nonsense is that? How could they not see anything if my hCG levels were rising? It’s not like I was getting the ultrasound the day after a missed period.” She insisted on another examination. “Only after I started arguing did they finally confirm the pregnancy — saying they’d just now seen it,” she says.</p>
  <p>What happened next took her by surprise. Instead of asking whether she wanted to continue the pregnancy, the doctor immediately began congratulating her. “Pregnancy isn’t always welcome. It wasn’t for me. I told her I wanted an abortion — not a congratulations.” After that, she says, the moralizing began: “The doctor, with a very serious face, told me that in the 21st century, there can be no reason not to give birth.”</p>
  <p>Elizaveta explained that she had health issues and was taking medication that’s unsafe for pregnancy. Her concerns were brushed aside. “They didn’t even want to hear me out,” she recalls.</p>

  <p>Still, she persisted. “They told me I’d have to go through a mandatory consultation with a psychologist,” she recalls.</p>
  <blockquote>Without that, they wouldn’t approve an abortion under the public health insurance system. But I couldn’t see the psychologist right away — not the same day, not even the next. There was a waitlist. A week, maybe two. And after that, there’s the <a href=""https://www.interfax.ru/russia/217867"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘week of silence’</a> — mandatory since 2011, supposedly to give women time to think things over. That meant at least two more weeks added to my pregnancy term. I realized that at this rate, I’d miss the window for a medical abortion. And honestly, I think that was the goal.</blockquote>
  <p>Elizaveta then asked at the front desk about a medical abortion, which is listed as a <a href=""https://rpc.karelia.ru/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/%D0%A0%D0%9F%D0%A6_887-2-9.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">paid service</a> the center offers — she assumed that if it wasn’t covered under public insurance, she could at least pay out of pocket. “But they said the same thing: to get a medical abortion — even privately — you still have to go through the psychologist,” she says. “You still have to wait for an appointment. Then comes the ‘week of silence.’ Just like with the public option. So again, there was no way I’d make it in time for a medical abortion. It felt like a trap,” she recalls.</p>
  <p>She began searching for private clinics in Petrozavodsk, only to find that none were licensed to perform abortions anymore. “I was truly shocked. I never imagined there would be no way to get even a private medical abortion anywhere in the region,” she says.</p>
  <h4>Russia's anti-abortion turn</h4><ul><li><a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/11/05/as-russia-targets-abortion-and-childfree-propaganda-to-raise-birth-rates-pregnant-at-16-reality-show-rebrands-to-make-motherhood-more-appealing""><b>As Russia targets abortion and ‘childfree propaganda’ to raise birth rates, ‘Pregnant at 16’ reality show rebrands to make motherhood more appealing</b> </a></li></ul>
  <p>Her only options were to try for a surgical abortion through the local perinatal center — or travel to St. Petersburg. “I was overwhelmed. I didn’t want a surgical abortion — it’s more invasive and carries more risks. But in Karelia, there just weren’t any other options. Medical abortion at the perinatal center was clearly off the table. And I couldn’t be sure they wouldn’t stall long enough for me to miss the window for a surgical abortion too,” she says.</p>
  <p>Looking for answers, Elizaveta turned to pro-choice communities and Telegram channels — and realized she wasn’t alone. Many other women shared similar experiences.</p>
  <blockquote>Reading other women’s stories in these pro-choice communities, I learned that clinics will ‘lose’ lab results, claim there are abnormal findings, and require consultations not only with a psychologist, but with a social worker too — anything to stall and run down the clock.</blockquote>
  <p>In the end, Elizaveta decided to travel to St. Petersburg, where she quickly found a private clinic that agreed to perform a medical abortion. It had only been a few days since her last appointment in Petrozavodsk. “When I saw the doctor in St. Petersburg, they told me I was already almost eight weeks along. That meant I would’ve had almost no time left even for a surgical abortion back in Petrozavodsk, once you factor in the psychologist appointment and the ‘week of silence.’ I was lucky the clinic I found still offered medical abortions at that stage,” she says.</p>
  <p>The experience reminded her of stories from abroad. “I’d read about women <a href=""https://glasnaya.org/2023/08/08/kak-polskie-aktivistki-borjutsya-za-pravo-na-abort/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">in Poland</a> having to travel to other countries for abortions, but I never thought I’d be in the same boat,” she says. “We never had such strict restrictions. Abortion isn’t banned — it’s still technically available through public healthcare and even listed among paid services. I think it’s all kept quiet on purpose — so people don’t speak out or even realize there’s a problem.”</p>

<strong>‘B</strong>latantly manipulative<strong>’</strong>

  <p>The website of the Karelia Regional Perinatal Center features a section titled <a href=""https://rpc.karelia.ru/%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%84%d0%be%d1%80%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d1%8f-%d0%be%d0%b1-%d0%b0%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%80%d1%82%d0%b5/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">“Information about abortion.”</a> One article, called <a href=""https://rpc.karelia.ru/%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%BE%D0%B1-%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B5/%D0%BE-%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5-%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">“The harm of abortion,”</a> discusses so-called ""post-abortion syndrome,” describing it as a “complication of pregnancy termination on par with inflammation, bleeding, or adhesions.” However, post-abortion syndrome is not recognized in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, and there are no clear diagnostic criteria for it.</p>
  <p>Glasnaya asked Alina, a pro-choice activist from Petrozavodsk, to comment on the information on the center’s website. Alina is a former midwife and currently a medical student. “The materials are blatantly manipulative,” she says. “For example, the authors use vague phrases like ‘medical psychologists and psychotherapists believe’ or ‘it has been proven that life begins at conception.’ But there’s not a single citation — no indication of who supposedly believes this or what the proof is.”</p>
  <p>Alina also notes that rare complications are presented on the site as if they’re common and to be expected.</p>

  <p>She recommends referring to the official Russian <a href=""https://jasulib.org.kg/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BA%D0%B5-%D0%93.%D0%91.-%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82-%D0%B2-%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">clinical guidelines</a> for medical abortion, which are based on evidence and cite hundreds of studies:</p>
  <blockquote>Here’s what they say: “The rate of heavy bleeding requiring uterine curettage is between 0.23 and 2.6 percent (1.4 percent up to 49 days of amenorrhea, and 2.6 percent up to 63 days). The incidence of bleeding requiring a blood transfusion (500 ml or more) is one in 1,000 cases. […] The rate of infectious complications in two large studies involving 34,000 and 46,421 women up to 26 weeks of pregnancy was one percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.”</blockquote>
  <p>In other cases, Alina says, the site crosses the line from manipulation into outright misinformation. For example, one page <a href=""https://rpc.karelia.ru/%d0%be-%d0%b2%d1%8b%d1%81%d0%be%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b9-%d0%b2%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%be%d1%8f%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b8-%d0%b1%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%bf%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%8f-%d0%bf%d0%be%d1%81%d0%bb/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">claims</a> that “doctors often observe infertility after a first abortion (especially if it’s the first pregnancy), followed by various reproductive issues (complications during pregnancy, miscarriage, infertility).” But according to the official clinical guidelines, “ovulation can resume as early as 8–10 days after an abortion — regardless of whether it was medical or surgical — and 78–83 percent of women ovulate during the first post-abortion cycle. […] Pregnancy termination in a medical setting, when free of complications, does not lead to infertility.”</p>
  <h3>
<strong>‘W</strong>ho decided we no longer have the right to our own bodies<strong>?’</strong>
</h3>
  <p>By March 2024, it was clear that access to abortion in Karelia had become a serious issue. A local resident named Lyubov <a href=""https://gubdaily.ru/article/frontpage/kto-zabral-u-zhenshhiny-pravo-vybora-v-petrozavodske-devushke-otkazalis-delat-medikamentoznyj-abort-pochti-vo-vsex-klinikax/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">contacted</a> the regional news outlet Daily Karelia after she was unable to find a single private clinic in the republic offering medical abortions.</p>
  <p>Lyubov had called every private provider in the regional capital. “This procedure used to be available to any woman here, in many clinics and hospitals,” she told journalists.</p>
  <blockquote>But this week, I haven’t been able to find a single place that will do it. Every clinic has turned me away, saying they received a directive from the Karelian Health Ministry banning the procedure. The ministry, meanwhile, denies having issued any such order. […] At public women’s health clinics, it feels like they’re deliberately stalling: tests, a mandatory psychologist visit, then the ‘week of silence.’ As a result, a woman might miss the legal window altogether. […] I don’t understand — who decided women in our republic no longer have the right to their own bodies? No law has been passed about any of this.</blockquote>
  <p>The only place still providing medical abortions was the regional perinatal center. But there, as with Elizaveta before her, Lyubov quickly realized she was unlikely to get the procedure in time.</p>
  <h4>Russia's birth rate problem</h4><ul><li><a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/10/22/russia-is-putting-pressure-on-women-to-boost-the-birth-rate-but-demographers-say-the-main-problem-is-too-many-people-dying""><b>Russia is putting pressure on women to boost the birth rate — but demographers say the main problem is too many people dying</b> </a></li></ul>
  <p>Journalists from Daily Karelia <a href=""https://gubdaily.ru/article/frontpage/kto-zabral-u-zhenshhiny-pravo-vybora-v-petrozavodske-devushke-otkazalis-delat-medikamentoznyj-abort-pochti-vo-vsex-klinikax/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">reached out</a> to the Karelian Health Ministry. Officials responded that there was no ban on abortions in state clinics and that private providers had stopped offering them due to a “lack of licenses.” The ministry’s press office was unable to point to any specific law or official directive behind the shift but referenced a 2020 order requiring that abortions be performed in inpatient settings. When asked why the procedures had been allowed in outpatient clinics for nearly four years after the order was issued, the ministry had no answer.</p>
  <p>Later reporting suggested the change had originated with the regional prosecutor’s office. Until 2017, a general license for obstetrics and gynecology included the right to perform abortions. That year, abortion was <a href=""https://www.consultant.ru/law/hotdocs/48163.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">reclassified</a> as a separate medical service requiring its own license. Clinics that held the older licenses were initially told by the regional Health Ministry that their documents remained valid — and continued offering abortions accordingly. That changed in early 2024, when prosecutors and health inspectors began visiting clinics and informing them that abortions could no longer be performed under the old licenses.</p>
  <p>Now, clinics are facing serious obstacles to obtaining new licenses, as the updated requirements mandate that the facility include an inpatient unit, operating room, and intensive care ward. (In Karelia, licenses cannot be issued solely for medical abortions.) In effect, if a clinic wants to provide any kind of abortion, it must be equipped to offer all types — including surgical ones.</p>
  <p>Pro-choice activist Alina corroborated this information. “Yes, it’s tied to licensing changes. The logic is that if a clinic provides medical abortions, it must also be prepared to perform surgical evacuation of the uterus in case of an incomplete abortion. That might sound reasonable. But according to <a href=""https://jasulib.org.kg/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BA%D0%B5-%D0%93.%D0%91.-%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82-%D0%B2-%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Russian clinical guidelines</a>, incomplete abortions happen in only 0.5–0.6 percent of cases.

  <p>Alina believes that purported concern for women’s health is being used as a pretext for imposing covert restrictions.</p>
  <p>“Realistically, maybe one in a thousand women would need further medical care. That’s not a serious burden on the healthcare system,"" she explains. ""But now everyone is being funneled into the perinatal center, which — according to its own website — only provides medical abortions up to six weeks. But most women don’t even learn they’re pregnant until the fourth or fifth week."" She continues:</p>
  <blockquote>It’s important to remember that doctors date pregnancies not from the moment of conception, but from the first day of a woman’s last period — the so-called gestational or obstetric weeks. So if you think you became pregnant two weeks ago, your official term is already four weeks. If it’s been three weeks, then it’s counted as five. Add to that the mandatory ‘week of silence,’ the psychologist consultation, and potential delays — like those Elizaveta faced — and it becomes almost impossible to meet the deadline for a medical abortion.</blockquote>
  <h3><strong>‘They send women 200 kilometers away to give birth’</strong></h3>
  <p>In July 2024, Karelia’s Committee on Health and Social Policy <a href=""https://glasnaya.media/2024/07/09/studentkam-iz-karelii-budut-vyplachivat-po-100-tysyach-rublej-za-rody-do-25-let/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">approved</a> a new social benefits program: a one-time payment of 100,000 rubles ($1,200) for students under 25 who give birth. The initiative, proposed by Karelia’s head Artur Parfenchikov, was backed by deputies from United Russia, the right-wing Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR), the Pensioners’ Party, and the New People party.</p>
  <p>At the committee meeting, deputy Emilia Slabunova <a href=""https://karelia-zs.ru/presssluzhba/videoarhiv/2024_07_09_komitet_po_zdravoohraneniyu_i_social_noj_politike/?p=4&amp;type=&amp;date_min=&amp;date_max="" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">raised concerns</a> about a clause excluding students whose babies are stillborn. “I have to say: this provision is completely wrong. When a young woman goes through childbirth and then suffers such a tragedy, denying her the 100,000 rubles she needs for recovery [is just wrong]. Maybe we could still extend the payment in those cases,” Slabunova said.</p>
  <h4>Sex in the Soviet Union</h4><ul><li><a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/04/12/yes-there-was-sex-in-the-ussr""><b>Yes, there was sex in the USSR</b> In a new book, historian Rustam Alexander expands his research on intimate life in the Soviet Union</a></li></ul>
  <p>Pro-choice activist Alina sees the push to lower the age of first childbirth as misguided. “A lot of officials seem to believe that the earlier a woman has her first child, the more children she’ll eventually have. But that’s just not true,"" she explains.</p>
  <blockquote>In the 1990s, Russian women were having their first babies <a href=""https://t.me/tochno_st/398"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">younger</a> — the average age was 22.6 in 1994, compared to 26.2 today — but that didn’t lead to higher birth rates. In countries like Israel, the U.S., and Australia, women tend to have children <a href=""https://t.me/RakshaDemography/3098"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">later</a> than in Russia, yet their fertility rates are higher. There’s no direct link between the age of first childbirth and the number of children a woman ends up having. More often, it’s poor-quality reproductive and maternity care that discourages women from having more — or any — children.</blockquote>
  <p>Darya (named changed), another Karelia resident, tells Glasnaya she's felt pressure from doctors to have kids even outside the context of abortion. “In November 2023, I was hospitalized for hyperplasia and underwent a scraping procedure — without anesthesia. They gave me painkillers only afterward,” she recalls.</p>
  <blockquote>Last year, I saw a gynecologist every three or four months for check-ups. Every time I walked in, the first question was, “Why haven’t you had kids yet?” If I said, “I don’t want to,” they’d give me a sour look. I’m sure if I tried to get an abortion, the pressure would be three times worse — and the delays even longer. And all of this was happening in a town without a maternity ward. They send women to Segezha — 200 kilometers away (120 miles) — to give birth.”</blockquote>
  <p>Another resident, Vasilisa (name changed), describes her experience with the healthcare system in Petrozavodsk.</p>
  <blockquote>The specialized gynecological ward here was shut down. Now, patients like me are packed into two rooms in the second surgical department of the city’s emergency hospital. I spent a week there on pregnancy watch. It’s just a general surgery wing — with homeless patients, broken bathroom locks, the works. Maybe after the 20th week they’ll transfer you to the perinatal center, but that place serves the entire republic and it’s completely overwhelmed.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>There have already <a href=""https://gubdaily.ru/article/frontpage/zhitelnica-petrozavodska-rodila-mertvogo-rebenka-iz-za-vrachebnoj-oshibki-ee-mama-podelilas-istoriej-chtoby-uberech-drugix/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">been cases</a> of women scheduled to be admitted in their 40th week being turned away due to a lack of available beds. In one case, a woman’s placenta detached in her 41st week — the baby didn’t survive.</blockquote>
  <p>“That’s where I had my C-section,” Vasilisa recalls. “They rushed me from the ICU to the ward while a nurse shouted, ‘Run while there’s still a spot!’ And now they’ve dumped all abortion procedures on that same unit too.”</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, on January 28, 2025, Sergey Leonov, head of the State Duma’s Health Protection Committee, <a href=""https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22992301"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">announced</a> that abortions should only be performed through Russia’s national health insurance system:</p>
  <blockquote>I believe the government should oversee all abortions in Russia. If we restrict the procedure to the national insurance system, we’ll be able to ensure full compliance with all requirements — including mandatory psychological counseling and the so-called ‘waiting period.’</blockquote>
  <p>Alina believes this approach will only increase the burden on the already overwhelmed regional perinatal center:</p>
  <blockquote>We’re seeing this all over Russia — abortions being pushed out of private clinics. It’s often framed as a move to improve care, but public hospitals can’t just absorb more patients out of nowhere. It puts huge strain on the medical staff.</blockquote>
  <h3><strong>‘Denial of medical care’</strong></h3>
  <p>Glasnaya asked a lawyer from the Russian human rights organization <a href=""https://pravonaabort.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Right to Abortion</a> what options women have in situations like Elizaveta’s. She explains that under <a href=""https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_121895/?ysclid=m937bdrek7433542660"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Russian law</a>, a woman has the right to terminate a pregnancy up to 12 weeks. Since 2021, this 12-week limit has also applied to medication abortions. The latest <a href=""https://diseases.medelement.com/disease/%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82-%D0%BA%D0%BF-%D1%80%D1%84-2024/18023"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">clinical guidelines</a> confirm that medication abortions are permitted up to 12 weeks — not just up to the eighth or ninth week, as some still claim based on outdated <a href=""https://rokptd.ru/uploads/userfiles/organization_267/klinictskie-rekomendacii/11(1).pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">2015 recommendations</a>.</p>
  <p>“This means medical institutions cannot pressure a woman into opting for a surgical procedure if she’s within the legal timeframe,” the lawyer emphasizes. “If a woman seeks care close to the 12-week mark, the clinic is required to provide the service without enforcing the ‘mandatory waiting period.’”</p>
  <h4>Russia's demographic problems</h4><ul><li><a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/09/10/russia-had-one-of-the-world-s-highest-life-expectancy-gender-gaps-then-putin-sent-hundreds-of-thousands-of-men-to-war""><b>Russia had one of the world’s highest life expectancy gender gaps. Then Putin sent hundreds of thousands of men to war.</b> </a></li></ul>
  <p>Refusing to schedule an appointment or delaying the process amounts to a denial of medical care. According to the lawyer, safety should always be healthcare providers’ top priority — and the earlier a medication abortion is performed, the lower the health risks for the woman. Healthcare providers therefore have an obligation to carry out procedures promptly, as delays increase medical risks.</p>
  <p>“Psychologist consultations before an abortion are mandatory, but unnecessary delays in this step are unacceptable. Abortion is a time-sensitive medical procedure, and prolonged waits for a consultation can violate a patient’s rights,” the lawyer says.</p>
  <p>After Elizaveta's experience, she spent several months dealing with anxiety and a sense of helplessness:</p>
  <blockquote>I felt like I’d lost control over my own life. It was emotionally very difficult — realizing that I couldn’t make decisions about my own body. And just because I happen to live here, not somewhere else.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>I’ve become much more cautious about contraception and stay more informed about any new laws regarding reproductive rights. Now, I follow reproductive justice channels on Telegram and donate to pro-choice initiatives. I don’t want anyone else to go through what I did.</blockquote>

            <p>Ukraine is not poised to win the conflict with Russia, US Vice President J.D. Vance has said. He added that it would be naive to expect the larger country&rsquo;s collapse if fighting continues for several more years.</p>
<p>Vance, a US Marine Corps veteran, has long contended that American support for the war in Ukraine diverts resources from domestic priorities and risks unnecessary conflict with Russia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If this doesn&rsquo;t stop, the Ukrainians aren&rsquo;t winning the war,&rdquo;</em> Vance said during an interview with Charlie Kirk during the conservative activist&rsquo;s podcast on Monday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s this weird idea among the mainstream media that if this thing goes on for just another few years, the Russians will collapse, the Ukrainians will take their territory back, and everything will go back to the way that it was before the war. That is not the reality that we live in,&rdquo;</em> the vice president said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You could have millions of more people killed if this thing goes on for another few years, and it could risk escalating into a nuclear war. It has to stop,&rdquo;</em> Vance added.</p>
<p>American negotiators are&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;making progress,&rdquo; </em>despite the challenges of dealing with both sides, Vance claimed.</p>

<p>Vance&rsquo;s remarks came as Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russian troops would observe a three-day ceasefire starting on May 8&nbsp;to commemorate the&nbsp;Soviet Union&rsquo;s victory over Germany in World War II. Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky responded by accusing Moscow of <em>&ldquo;manipulation&rdquo;</em> and called for an immediate 30-day ceasefire.</p>

            <p></p>
<p>China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry has refuted US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s claim that he recently spoke with President Xi Jinping. Speaking to the press in Ceiling on Monday, the ministry noted that neither side is working toward a tariff agreement.</p>
<p>In an interview with Time magazine published on Friday, the Trump claimed that his administration was in talks with China to reach a tariff agreement and that President Xi had called him. Beijing has repeatedly denied any such discussions are underway and accused Washington of <em>&ldquo;misleading the public.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s called. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a sign of weakness on his behalf,&rdquo;</em> Trump said in the interview, referring to Xi. The American president did not say, however, when the call took place or specify what was discussed.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;As far as I know, there have not been any calls between the two presidents recently,&rdquo;</em> Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters. <em>&ldquo;I would like to reiterate that China and the US have not conducted consultations or negotiations on the tariffs issue.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to media reports, the Trump administration indicated it would consider lowering tariffs on certain Chinese imports, pending talks with Beijing.</p>
<p>China, meanwhile, has maintained a firm position on tariffs, insisting that the US must cancel all <em>&ldquo;unilateral&rdquo;</em> penalties if it wishes to resolve any trade dispute with Beijing.</p>

<p>Since last week, Trump has repeatedly claimed that his administration is engaged in trade talks with Chinese officials &mdash; only to be met each time with firm denials from Beijing.</p>
<p>Trump imposed sweeping tariffs, including a 145% levy on Chinese imports, earlier this month, on what he dubbed <em>&ldquo;Liberation Day.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The move was part of a broader campaign targeting more than 90 countries in an effort to address what Trump described as unfair trade imbalances. While most of the new tariffs have been delayed for 90 days &mdash; with a baseline 10% tariff remaining in effect &mdash; China was excluded from the reprieve. In response, Beijing imposed 125% tariffs on US goods and introduced restrictions on key exports.</p>
<p>Tensions between the world&rsquo;s two largest economies have fueled global market volatility. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded its global growth forecast, citing trade uncertainty as a major drag on economic output.</p>
<p>In its World Economic Outlook, the IMF projects global GDP growth at 2.8% for this year, down from 3.3% in 2024. It also lowered its forecast for US growth in 2025 to 1.8%, compared to 2.8% last year. Meanwhile, China&rsquo;s economy is expected to slow to 4%, reflecting efforts to counter the impact of Washington&rsquo;s tariffs.</p>",Mixed,negative

            <p></p>
<p>US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s team is considering a new strategy for North Korea, potentially mirroring the diplomatic engagement of his first term, according to sources cited by Axios.</p>
<p>Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in person multiple times, including in Singapore in 2018, Hanoi in 2019, and within the demilitarized zone on the Korean Peninsula later that same year. He is the first sitting US president ever to sit down at the negotiating table with his North Korean counterpart.</p>
<p>Trump has told his team that he wants to reconnect with Kim, potentially face-to-face, Axios reported on Sunday. The administration is <em>&ldquo;convening agencies to understand where the North Koreans are today,&rdquo;</em> said a senior official speaking on condition of anonymity. <em>&ldquo;A lot has changed in the last four years. We are evaluating, diagnosing and talking about potential avenues, including engagement.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Currently, this initiative is not among the White House&rsquo;s top priorities and involves consultations with external experts, including former officials and think tanks, the outlet said. Axios suggested that Washington holds less leverage over Pyongyang now than it did in the late 2010s, as North Korea has bolstered its military capabilities, including nuclear forces, and forged stronger ties with China and Russia.</p>

            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron was sidelined when his US counterpart Donald Trump and Vladimir Zelensky met before the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday. Footage from the Vatican showed him being left out despite the Ukrainian leader&rsquo;s apparent expectations that he would join.</p>
<p>Trump and Zelensky last met in February in the Oval Office. The meeting, where they&rsquo;d intended to finalize a US-Ukraine minerals agreement and discuss a potential ceasefire with Russia, ended abruptly amid a heated exchange involving Vice President J.D. Vance, which led to the Ukrainian leader&rsquo;s early departure from the White House.</p>
<p>Video footage from the Vatican showed Zelensky walking toward the seating area with Trump. He glanced back several times, reportedly expecting Macron to join. Three chairs were set up, suggesting plans for a three-way discussion. As the French president approached, Zelensky greeted him warmly with a smile and a hand gesture, inviting him to join.</p>
<p>However, just moments later, a staff member discreetly removed the third chair before the meeting began. Footage shows Trump gesturing openly while maintaining a firm posture, signaling the conversation would be strictly between him and Zelensky. Macron eventually stepped back as the two engaged directly.</p>
<p>Visuals captured Zelensky&rsquo;s expression changing from confident to visibly tense upon realizing he would face Trump alone. The 15-minute meeting took place against a backdrop of growing tensions; the US president has pressured Kiev to accept what media outlets have termed his <em>&ldquo;final offer&rdquo;</em> to end hostilities. Reports suggest that Washington&rsquo;s proposal involves freezing the conflict along the existing front lines and recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, a condition the Ukrainian leader has firmly rejected.</p>

<p>The Estonian president revealed that he&rsquo;d had a conversation with Trump at Pope Francis&rsquo; funeral on Saturday, where the two were seated together. Ahead of the ceremony, Trump also had a brief meeting with Ukraine&rsquo;s Vladimir Zelensky.</p>
<p>Karis said he had urged Trump to keep the Ukraine peace process moving and not to <em>&ldquo;walk away at some point.&rdquo;</em> The US president allegedly pledged to stay engaged in the negotiations, <em>&ldquo;saying we are quite close because he had just met Zelensky.

<p>Moscow has maintained that it targets only military installations and facilities used by Kiev&rsquo;s forces, rejecting accusations of deliberately striking civilian sites. Following a brief lull in fighting during the Easter ceasefire announced by President Vladimir Putin last weekend, the Russian military carried out multiple long-range strikes against Ukrainian military and industrial targets over the week.</p>

<p>Many Ukrainians, however, are reluctant to renounce future claims to Crimea, viewing any territorial compromise as setting a <em>&ldquo;dangerous precedent&rdquo;</em> for potential formal recognition of Moscow's control over four other former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia in 2022.</p>
<p>This comes as the US has clashed with European nations and Kiev over their vision for a Ukraine peace arrangement, with the sides presenting different proposals on the terms for ending the conflict, according to a Reuters report, which was confirmed by the WaPo.</p>
<p>In particular, US envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly proposed that Washington recognize Crimea as Russian and accept Moscow&rsquo;s de facto control over large parts of the other four regions. Meanwhile, Ukraine and its European supporters, however, reportedly continue to resist any mention of territorial recognition in the proposed agreements. Their version of a peace framework postpones territorial issues until after a ceasefire and emphasizes the necessity of strong security guarantees for Kiev.</p>
<p>For Europe and Ukraine, <em>&ldquo;it is not only reasonable but necessary to push back on some elements of the US proposal, as it gives Ukraine practically very, very little. And Russia a lot,&rdquo;</em> a Western official told the WaPo. The report also noted that Europe is trying to <em>&ldquo;edge Washington toward a more reasonable agreement,&rdquo;</em> including the recognition that a ceasefire must be an essential first step.</p>
<p>The WaPo report comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin held lengthy talks on Friday with Witkoff at the Kremlin on Friday.

The discussion was also long, lasting for about three hours.</p>
<p>Yet, at this point, we know little about its content or, more importantly, what progress has been made or not. <a href=""https://www.rt.com/russia/616310-putin-witkoff-talks-ushakov/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">We do know, from Russia&rsquo;s Yuri Ushakov</a>, special aide to Putin, that the meeting was, in&nbsp;his words, <em>&ldquo;constructive&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;useful.&rdquo;</em> In particular, it has produced closer proximity between the Russian and US positions, not only on Ukraine but also on other issues that have &ndash; mostly &ndash; not been further specified. With the important exception of the possibility of facilitating direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives.</p>
<p>Clearly, it is too early to draw strong conclusions about the meeting and its results. One thing that seems certain is that it was not a failure. Even if Ushakov&rsquo;s language was restrained, it did signal that much. Beyond that, however, we can only speculate: One thing we know from the meeting&rsquo;s context is that Trump has, once again, publicly displayed great dissatisfaction and impatience with Kiev and personally with Ukraine&rsquo;s leader Vladimir Zelensky. This time, using his own social media site Truth Social, Trump focused on Zelensky&rsquo;s refusal <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114388111141848447"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">to accept the loss of Crimea</a>. More broadly, he reminded Zelensky that he has little leverage (<em>&ldquo;no cards&rdquo;</em>) and that his stalling delays ending the war.</p>
<p>This intervention is in line with <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/trump-ukraine-russia-diplomacy-dayton/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">what Trump&rsquo;s critics furiously decry as a pattern of being soft on Russia and hard on Ukraine</a>. In principle, while exaggerating a little, the critics have a point. Trump has effectively reversed the former US approach, which consisted of pampering Ukraine and always blaming Russia. But what Trump&rsquo;s critics here fail to realize is that, on this issue, he is right. He cannot quite say it, but Russia is winning the war against both Ukraine and, in effect, the West. In this situation, a US president has two options: escalate further, most likely to, at least, a very large regional war in Europe and parts of Asia or finally speak to Russia in terms that Moscow can find acceptable. That is precisely what Trump has decided to do, at least for now. And anyone who wishes to avoid escalation has to agree with him, if not in detail, then fundamentally.</p>

<p>The latest round of talks between the Russian leadership and Witkoff confirm that Washington is staying the course outlined above. More broadly again, it also means that the US is not abandoning the style of its latest peace proposal for the Ukraine War. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/opinion/trump-ukraine-peace.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The latter is reported to offer</a> a freezing of current lines on the ground, the long overdue to Ukraine&rsquo;s NATO perspective (which, if it had come in late 2021 could have prevented the war&rsquo;s large-scale escalation), sanctions lifting, as well as recognizing Crimea as Russian.</p>
<p>These terms do not, actually, coincide with all of Russia&rsquo;s demands. But they try to meet Russian concerns as never before. <a href=""https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/lavrov-praises-trump-as-sole-leader-recognising-ukraine-conflict-roots/ar-AA1DAkwp?ocid=BingNewsSerp"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has pointed out</a>, Trump is unique among Western leaders in acknowledging the root causes of the war. In that sense, the US peace proposals show not only that Washington is now realistic about the situation on the ground (heavily in Russia&rsquo;s favor), but also that Trump&rsquo;s administration is principally ready to shape its concrete policy according to the insight referred to by Lavrov.</p>

<p>The framework, which has not been officially confirmed by the White House, reportedly includes US recognition of Crimea as Russian territory and acknowledgement of Moscow&rsquo;s control over large parts of four former Ukrainian regions that have joined Russia. US Vice President J.D. Vance has also stated that the administration is considering the option to <em>&ldquo;freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>CNN cited several unnamed diplomats who criticized the proposed settlement, claiming it would <em>&ldquo;reward&rdquo;</em> Russian President Vladimir Putin and send a <em>&ldquo;dangerous message&rdquo;</em> to other leaders, including China&rsquo;s Xi Jinping.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This is about the fundamental principles of international law,&rdquo;</em> one Eastern European diplomat told CNN, claiming that <em>&ldquo;if one country in Europe is forced to give up parts of its own legal territory&hellip; no country in Europe or elsewhere can feel safe, NATO or no NATO.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Moscow has repeatedly denied having any intention to strike NATO or EU countries, or claim their territories, accusing Western officials of <em>&ldquo;fearmongering&rdquo;</em> in order to justify further militarization.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many Eastern European governments, such as Poland and the Baltic states, have cited the supposed threat of a Russian attack as justification for increasing defense budgets and deploying additional forces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CNN report comes as US special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with Russian officials in Moscow for another round of talks in the coming days.

<p>Trump has publicly expressed frustration with Ukraine&rsquo;s Vladimir Zelensky, whom he has accused of obstructing peace efforts by refusing to even consider any territorial concessions. At the same time, the US president has suggested that he has found Russia easier to negotiate with than Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US president has been pushing for a resolution to the conflict, while also seeking a minerals extraction agreement with Ukraine to help offset the billions of dollars Washington has spent on military and financial aid. Trump temporarily halted military supplies and intelligence sharing with Kiev following a public dispute with Ukraine&rsquo;s Vladimir Zelensky at the White House in February.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Trump reiterated that Zelensky &ndash; who he&nbsp;once described as a <em>&ldquo;<a href=""https://www.rt.com/news/613025-trump-zelensky-dictator-elections/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">dictator without elections</a>&rdquo;</em> &ndash; has been <em>&ldquo;more difficult to deal with&rdquo;</em> than Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The report added that Kiev is now trying to renegotiate with Washington while simultaneously seeking support from its European sponsors.</p>
<p>Kiev is still receiving weapons pledged by the previous US administration, but no new aid packages have been authorized since Trump took office, Zelensky said on Monday. His recent pleas for additional Patriot batteries and missiles have also gone unanswered.</p>
<p>Moscow has maintained that it is open to peace talks, provided its core security demands are addressed. It opposes any NATO presence on Ukrainian soil and has demanded that Kiev recognize Russia&rsquo;s new borders and abandon its plans to join the US-led military bloc.

<p>Zelensky&rsquo;s declaration that Kiev would never recognize the peninsula as Russian also prompted a warning from Trump that he could lose the whole country if he continues stalling talks with Moscow.</p>
<p>Russia has repeatedly said that the status of Crimea and the four other former Ukrainian regions that joined Russia after referendums in 2022 is not up for negotiation. Moscow insists recognition of the <em>&ldquo;reality on the ground&rdquo;</em> is vital for a lasting peace.</p>

            <p>The ousting of longtime Syrian President Bashar Assad has ushered in a new chapter of uncertainty in the country&rsquo;s decades-long conflict.</p>
<p>Several questions remain regarding the surprising turn of events. Were the rebels externally backed? What are the implications for powers&nbsp;such as Russia? Will the ensuing power vacuum lead to the rise of new non-state actors?</p>
<p>It is apparent that the current power play is benefiting American and Israeli interests in the region. With the toppling of a key Russian partner and a major link in the Axis of Resistance against Israel, the geopolitics of the region will undergo a fundamental geopolitical shift.</p>
<p>Any hopes of resolving the Syrian question will be dim &ndash; nation-building has always been a more daunting, time-intensive, resource-consuming, and politically less rewarding process than orchestrating regime collapse. Given that Western governments share a voluminous&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.vox.com/2014/8/25/6065529/isis-rise"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">history</a> of exploiting grassroots organizations &ndash; from pro-democracy protest groups to the mujahedeen and Islamist outfits &ndash; to further their geostrategic ambitions, it is likely that the successful offensive by Islamist radicals against the Assad regime had tacit Western blessings.</p>
<p>Even though the US secretary of state only recently&nbsp;<a href=""https://apnews.com/article/blinken-syria-assad-hts-transition-mideast-5fcff887a74dc9ec36e483c0b601a8c2"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">confirmed</a> that Washington is in contact with Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) &ndash; a rebrand of the terrorist Al-Nusra Front affiliated with Al-Qaeda &ndash; US forces based in Syria had been actively&nbsp;<a href=""https://theintercept.com/2024/12/05/us-military-attacked-syria/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">aiding</a> opposition groups at Deir Ezzor during the offensive against the Syrian regime. Furthermore, the neutral to positive coverage meted out to terrorist outfits, especially HTS, by referring to them with euphemistically neutral terms (<em>&ldquo;rebels&rdquo;</em>) despite the group being sanctioned by the&nbsp;<a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158126"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">United Nations</a>, the US&nbsp;<a href=""https://x.com/wikileaks/status/1865668192636657752?t=UEPF0sSh8fT33UScIjqgMg&amp;s=19"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">government</a>, and other states as a terrorist organization prominently conveys America&rsquo;s tilt in the current geostrategic developments.</p>
<p>The trend also reflected the proactiveness (or desperation) of the erstwhile Biden administration to attempt to mould US foreign policy post-election, that is, before&nbsp;leaving office&nbsp;in January 2025. The authorization to use ATACMS on Russia, the unrest in Georgia, the toppling of the Assad regime in Syria and subsequent Israeli violations of Syrian sovereignty are dots connecting the same pattern.</p>
<p>One can hope that Washington has learned its lessons from Afghanistan (which led to a strengthening of the Taliban) and its Iraqi fiasco (which led to the birth of the Islamic State), and that it won&rsquo;t follow the same playbook in Syria. Elements&nbsp;of reform have been visible &ndash; despite the collapse of the Assad regime, government ministries are still functioning. The Islamist opposition leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani&nbsp;previously&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/052ff79a-50a5-4e24-81df-384927961749"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">called</a> for an end to the prosecution and eradication of rivals and rallied focus instead on nation-building.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><a></a>Syria: The new grand chessboard</h2>
<p>The sudden fast-paced downfall of the Assad regime underscores its chronic internal decay. For years, Syria had been rotting from within, with signs of systemic failure becoming increasingly evident. The ubiquitous change of flags at Syrian embassies worldwide and the <a href=""https://carnegieendowment.org/middle-east/diwan/2024/12/anatomy-of-a-military-fall?lang=en"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">defections</a> of key military figures illustrate profound dissatisfaction with Assad&rsquo;s governance at the institutional level. While Russia provided significant military backing, it was never the primary political advisor to Assad. The inherent internal instability, which&nbsp;may have been <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/demoralised-abandoned-by-allies-why-assads-army-failed-fight-syria-2024-12-12/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">manifested</a> through corruption, mismanagement, and crumbling loyalty within the Syrian army, ultimately made external support futile. These factors demonstrate that Russia&rsquo;s role in Syria&nbsp;was limited to military facilitation rather than comprehensive regime stabilization.</p>
<p>While Westerners insist on pointing to a strategic loss for Russia, Moscow's strategic priorities in Syria have evolved since its initial intervention in 2015. At that time, Syria served as a critical arena for breaking the international isolation Russia faced following its integration of Crimea. By intervening <a href=""https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3180.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">decisively</a>, with&nbsp;an official invitation in accordance with international law, Moscow projected itself as a resilient power capable of advancing its interests despite Western sanctions. Syria also acted as a showcase for Russian military capabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of its weapons systems and operational strategies to potential buyers.</p>
<p>However, several factors have diminished Syria&rsquo;s strategic importance to Russia.</p>
<p>Initially, Russia&rsquo;s involvement in Syria was believed by some to have been at least partly aimed at <a href=""https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/is-the-fight-over-a-gas-pipeline-fuelling-the-worlds-bloodiest-conflict/news-story/74efcba9554c10bd35e280b63a9afb74"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">preventing</a> Qatar from establishing a gas pipeline to Europe, which would have undercut Russian dominance in the European energy market. Today, with Russia&rsquo;s gas exports to Europe significantly reduced, this objective has lost relevance. Furthermore, the diversification of global energy sources and the rise of LNG markets have further diluted the importance of blocking a Qatari pipeline through Syria into Europe.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s military campaign in Syria also provided an <a href=""https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2018/march/syria-russias-military-proving-ground"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">opportunity</a> to test and market its advanced weaponry. This mission was largely successful, but the conflict in Ukraine has now become the primary stage for showcasing Russian military technology under real combat conditions. The deployment of systems showcased by the Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile highlighted Russia&rsquo;s continued innovation in military technology. Ukraine has become a proving ground for Russian military tech, further reducing Syria&rsquo;s importance in this regard.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s campaign in Syria was previously driven by the goal of eradicating ISIS, a mission largely <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/world/russian-military-mission-accomplished-islamic-state-defeated-in-syria-idUSKBN1E11R3/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">accomplished</a> in 2017 with a limited military contingent. ISIS now being significantly weaker than it was in 2015 marked a clear achievement for Russian forces. With the group no longer posing a major threat, Moscow&rsquo;s justification for maintaining a robust presence in Syria has weakened. The focus has shifted to broader regional stability rather than counterterrorism operations.</p>

<p>In January 2025, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for Russia to <a href=""https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/laenderinformationen/syrien-node/baerbock-syria-2692372"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">withdraw</a> its military bases from Syria, citing concerns over foreign interference in Syria&rsquo;s internal affairs. However, the demand has been criticized as hypocritical, given Germany&rsquo;s silence on the presence of US military bases in Syria, which also operate without explicit international legal authorization. As of January 2025, Russia maintained two key military facilities in Syria: the Khmeimim Air Base and the naval base in Tartus. However, Syria&rsquo;s decision to <a href=""https://tass.com/world/1902511"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">terminate</a> the Tartus port management contract with a Russian company has disrupted military logistics, complicating Russia&rsquo;s position. However,&nbsp;a continuous shift to the east is still evident even in the Middle East. Russia seems to be executing a strategic pivot to Libya, relocating significant naval assets to the ports of Misrata and Al-Hums. This move grants Russia unprecedented access to the central Mediterranean, placing NATO&rsquo;s southern flank, including bases in Italy and Greece, within close operational range.</p>
<p>Baerbock&rsquo;s call for Russia to leave Syria reflects Germany&rsquo;s alignment with broader Western efforts to curb Russian influence in the Middle East. However, the lack of similar demands for the withdrawal of US forces undermines the credibility of this stance, exposing the geopolitical double standards often employed by Western powers. For Russia, maintaining its bases in Syria was not just about preserving influence but also about avoiding the humiliation of abandoning critical assets, as witnessed in the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Yet, Russia&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-syria-africa-libya/33247673.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">relocation</a> of naval assets to Libya&nbsp;may now represent a calculated move to counterbalance its declining influence in Syria while attempting to expand its geopolitical reach. By establishing a strengthened foothold in Libya, Russia may gain leverage over NATO&rsquo;s southern flank and the ability to monitor alliance operations in real time, significantly enhancing its tactical advantages in the Mediterranean. This dual strategy underscores Russia&rsquo;s adaptability in navigating shifting geopolitical landscapes, ensuring it remains a key player in global security dynamics despite the regional challenges.</p>
<h2><a></a>What does the future hold for Syria?</h2>
<p>The current situation provides two major future possibilities:</p>
<p>The first arises out of a power vacuum in Syria. In this scenario, where the HTS can&rsquo;t reach a compromise with the other factions of the rebel coalition, the situation quickly devolves into infighting among the rebel groups, providing fertile ground for the rise of new radical outfits akin to ISIS. Rather than working towards maintaining harmony, the existence of a power vacuum would be expediently exploited by external interests such as the US, T&uuml;rkiye, and Israel to carve out their own zones of influence. In such a scenario, whether the Kremlin succeeds in carving out a Russian sphere of its own is up for debate.</p>
<p>A fractured Syria will consequently be a haven for numerous groups and coalitions supported by&nbsp;a myriad of external powers (which may cooperate or even compete with each other) transforming into a playground for foreign power projection. Rivalries and conflicts will provide a lucrative testing ground&nbsp;for the arsenals of major countries. Areas with rich natural resources (<a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/politics/us-damage-assessment-syria-iraq/index.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">US-controlled</a> Syrian oil fields) will assist in maintaining influence in the region. Proxies will be utilized for combating states antithetical to the external interests &ndash; US bases in Al Tanf and Deir Ezzor were utilized to counter Iranian influence and enhance sudden strike capabilities.</p>

<p>The current outreach may also be construed as proactive American involvement in the Middle East to counter Russian influence, as well as recent Russian and Chinese geostrategic advances in Africa. Since Russian bases in Syria acted as critical logistical hubs for Russian operations in the Sahel region, Washington may have hoped that the demise of a longtime Syrian ally would complicate Moscow&rsquo;s options and strain supply chains to Russian mercenary groups, thus diminishing their regional influence. Russian intelligence agencies have <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-uk-plotting-terrorist-acts-to-oust-russian-forces-from-their-bases-in-syria-spy-service-101735370494926.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">suggested</a> that the US and UK are plotting <em>&ldquo;terrorist attacks&rdquo;</em> against Russian bases in hopes of further destabilizing the fragile situation.</p>
<p>Ongoing Israeli action in Syria is backed by confidence that US President Donald Trump is sympathetic to the Israeli cause. The current violations of Syrian territorial sovereignty and military deployments on the ground within Syria are being met with silent approval from Washington. While hitching&nbsp;one's wagon&nbsp;to a greater power has its benefits,&nbsp;this&nbsp;may complicate domestic support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if his current policy of expansionism-to-placate-the-masses hits a roadblock or if Israel suffers&nbsp;significant casualties&nbsp;in any of the numerous conflicts it is involved in.</p>
<p>For the Kremlin, the situation is complicated but not yet hopeless. While the loss of the old regime ended decades of regional partnership, the Russians can still reach an <a href=""https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/12/16/the-secret-talks-between-syrias-new-leaders-and-the-kremlin"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">agreement</a> with the new government and strive to break <a href=""https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/12/13/russia-seeking-to-retain-influence-and-relations-with-new-syrian-regime"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">new ground</a> with the nascent regime. Providing diplomatic and logistical, possibly even military support in exchange for continued Russian <a href=""https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/12/syria-russia-new-relationships?lang=en"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">operations</a> in the country can be an initial step towards building relations with the new regime. Providing reparations to the coup leaders with the demanded return of <a href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/29/russia-tight-lipped-on-syrian-demand-of-al-assad-for-military-bases"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Assad</a> to Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa may be in the position to bargain to allow Russia to keep its influence for the benefit of the Syrian regime and its people. The question remains open which side actually is in desperate need of the other. On the tactical scale,&nbsp;maintaining a hard posture may be advantageous to show the strength of the pioneer Syrian government during talks with leading powers. Yet, from the strategic point of view, it may be in the interests of Syria itself to keep Russian influence in order to maintain the status quo strategic balance and not follow the path paved by Libya, Iraq, or Afghanistan.</p>
<p>However, the question of whether Bashar Assad will be surrendered to the new Syrian regime remains open. His continued presence poses a potential obstacle to the evolving bilateral relations between Russia and the newly established Syrian government. Granting Assad asylum presents a considerable challenge to achieving a mutually acceptable foundation for cooperation, as it complicates efforts to reset relations and align national interests from the outset. However, Russia&rsquo;s approach to diplomatic negotiations differs fundamentally from that of Western powers, where pragmatism and self-interest often take precedence. Moscow places significant emphasis on interpersonal relationships and expects reciprocal loyalty in its strategic engagements.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin has cultivated a stable and trusting relationship with Bashar Assad, and despite the rapid collapse and apparent fragility of Assad&rsquo;s regime, Russia&rsquo;s willingness to offer asylum serves as a broader signal of its commitment to supporting its allies, even in adverse circumstances. Unlike the US, which has historically <a href=""https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Saudi-Arabia-Well-support-Egypt-if-US-cuts-aid"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">withdrawn</a> support from leaders such as Hosni Mubarak or Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Russia&rsquo;s strategic calculus suggests that Assad&rsquo;s fate is unlikely to be a focal point in future negotiations between Moscow and Damascus. Over time, the new Syrian leadership will be compelled to adapt to this reality, shifting its demands toward other concessions that Russia may find more acceptable.</p>
<p>The second possibility deals with a stronger HTS successfully reaching a compromise with the rebel groups. Whether this evolves into a working coalition incorporating the other rebel factions or HTS balances by providing regional territorial influence within Syria remains to be seen.</p>
<p>If the new Syrian government decides to renegotiate military agreements, including the removal of Russian bases, Moscow&rsquo;s leverage in the region could diminish. However, this scenario is far from certain. The current <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/06/syria-defense-minister-russia-bases/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">government</a> has not declared Russia an adversary, focusing instead on Iran and Hezbollah as primary concerns. This divergence from the narrative presented by much of the Western media, which often portrays Russia&rsquo;s position as unequivocally weakened, highlights the complexities of the situation. Rather than an outright loss, the ambiguity surrounding Russia&rsquo;s role could offer Moscow greater space to maneuver diplomatically and strategically in the region.</p>
<p>While the collapse of the Syrian government poses new challenges, it does not fundamentally alter Russia&rsquo;s position in the Middle East.&nbsp;Its strategic interests in Syria have shifted over the years. Although uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the future of Russian military bases, the absence of direct hostility from the new Syrian government provides room for maneuver. Ultimately, Syria&rsquo;s downfall highlights the limits of external intervention in stabilizing fragile regimes, reinforcing the notion that Russia&rsquo;s role in Syria has always been one of measured engagement rather than unconditional commitment.</p>",Mixed,positive

            <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and President Donald Trump&rsquo;s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, have accused Politico of publishing <em>&ldquo;fiction&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;fake crap,&rdquo;</em> over a report by the media outlet on a potential Ukraine peace deal.</p>
<p>In an article on Wednesday, Politico claimed that Washington is considering lifting sanctions on Russia&rsquo;s Nord Stream pipeline and <em>&ldquo;other Russian assets in Europe&rdquo;</em> as part of its peace efforts. Citing <em>&ldquo;five people familiar with the discussions,&rdquo;</em> Politico said Witkoff was the <em>&ldquo;main proponent&rdquo;</em> of the plan, allegedly due to a developing <em>&ldquo;friendship&rdquo;</em> with Russian President Vladimir Putin in his role as Trump&rsquo;s envoy. The piece also claimed Rubio opposed the idea and quoted analysts warning it could hurt US LNG exports by reopening the EU market to Russian gas.</p>
<p>Rubio was quick to respond, writing on X that the <em>&ldquo;piece of fiction&rdquo;</em> was <em>&ldquo;unequivocally false.&rdquo;</em> Witkoff responded with sharper language, calling the article <em>&ldquo;fake crap.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Rubio and Witkoff are among the key figures in US-Russia discussions aimed at ending the Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p>While the US-proposed peace framework has not been made public, reports suggest it could involve recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. Ukraine&rsquo;s Vladimir Zelensky recently dismissed any such proposals as <em>&ldquo;unconstitutional,&rdquo;</em> prompting Trump to accuse him of jeopardizing the peace process with <em>&ldquo;inflammatory statements&rdquo;</em> and warning that he could <em>&ldquo;lose the whole country&rdquo;</em> if he does not compromise.</p>

468,RT English,"Lost Illusions, or How the International Criminal Court has become a legal nonentity",https://www.rt.com/news/616171-lost-illusions-icc-nonentity/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS,2025-04-24 04:34:02,"<p><em>Quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi</em></p>
<p>The world keeps changing, and not always for the better. We have witnessed the rapid degradation of many supranational legal structures, which have fallen victim to their dependence on the will, funding and values of the so-called collective West. This is true, for instance, for the International Criminal Court (the Hague Criminal Court). The good intentions which guided those who established it two decades ago have evidently paved the road to hell. The further, the more so.</p>
<p>Deplorable as it may seem, it is more than natural. Suffice it to remember the history of this legal institution, which has gone a short way from alleged demand to full uselessness on the edge of absurdity, bias and cynicism. <em>It is important to understand what its current actions are conditioned by, how to react to them and what, in the end, shall replace this international body, which has compromised itself so quickly.</em></p>
<h2>1.</h2>
<p>It all started ceremoniously, so to say. A craving for justice has always united millions of people on Earth. History holds examples of falling empires, whose rulers at some point went euphoric due to their own lawlessness, only to be swept away in the blink of an eye by the popular wrath. Yet it is usually difficult to bring the powerful of this world to justice for crimes against the public good and humanity. That is why supranational judicial authorities, not being subject to any national government, are endowed with this task.</p>
<p>Establishment of international criminal tribunals after the Second World War was the first attempt in history to assert the supremacy of law on a global scale, to achieve justice and real equality beyond state, economic and ideological borders. The Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals committed themselves to the task which the courts of Germany, Japan and their former allies could not have accepted the responsibility for.</p>
<p>When the work of the international tribunals ended, legal scholars from various countries proposed the establishment of a permanent international judicial body, which could bring to justice those to blame for the most violent crimes against humanity. The lingering Cold war impeded these plans. It was only on the cusp of the 1990s that the idea of a permanent international criminal court was revived&sup1;, and in 1998 in Rome the Statute of the International Criminal Court was signed as its charter document.</p>
<p>The ICC was established as an independent international organisation. Its main body is the Assembly of States Parties, which includes all member states (125 at present). The Assembly has a Bureau which shall assist the Assembly in the discharge of its responsibilities (art. 112(3) of the Rome statute). The main function, i.e. bringing to justice those who committed the &lsquo;most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole&rsquo;, is vested in the ICC. The Court consists of 18 judges, elected by the Assembly, the office of the Prosecutor, elected by the same body, and the Secretariat. The judges function as part of the Pre-Trial Chamber, which initiates criminal proceedings and issues arrest warrants; the Judicial divisions, which consider the case on the merits; the Appeals division, which reviews claims in respect of acts and decisions of the lower divisions; and the Presidency, which <em>inter alia </em>is responsible for the &lsquo;proper administration of the Court, with the exception of the Office of the Prosecutor&rsquo; (art 38(3) of the Rome Statute). The head of it is the President.</p>
<p>Under art.119 of the Statute, the Court may, on its own motion, determine the admissibility of any case. Thus, the Court is the only and supreme instance in disputes it is involved in, i.e. it performs as a judge in its own case (which, in fact, contradicts the <em>nemo judex in propria causa&sup2;</em>&nbsp;principle). All judges and other employees of the ICC have international immunity and privileges on the territories of the member states, including the Netherlands, where it is seated.</p>
<p>The ICC has jurisdiction over the most serious crimes, namely genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Yet its jurisdiction is not universal and covers only crimes committed on the territory of its member states or by citizens of its member states.&sup3; Apart from the abovementioned controversial points, the Court&rsquo;s Statute has contained other provisions from the very beginning which in many cases could render impossible the enforcement of its decisions (and they have, as we will see later).</p>
<p>In any case, in 2002 the ICC Statute was ratified by the required number of member states and came into force on July 1 of the same year. Back then, the situation in the world was absolutely different from what we can see now. It was clear that approval of the Rome Statute (like any other international treaty) required representatives of more than a hundred nations to seek mutually acceptable wording, striving for enhancement of the cooperation in this sphere. Consistently advocating full compliance with the UN Charter, the countries assumed that any contradictions could be gradually eliminated with a focus on the key principles of the international law enshrined in the UN documents. Taking this into consideration, the Russian Ministry of International Affairs approved the execution of the Rome Statute in the name and on behalf of the Russian Federation in 2000.</p>
<p>Yet later the Hague Criminal Court displayed its political bias. The ICC itself com- mitted grave violations of the acknowledged principles of international law. Against this political and legal background, in 2016 Russia decided not to be party to the Rome Statute⁴. The U.S. and several other countries acted in the same way. Taking into consideration that China did not sign the Rome Statute, three out of five permanent members of the UN Security Council are not parties to it.</p>
<h2>2.</h2>
<p>The global community placed serious hopes on the Hague Criminal Court at first. Yet at the very moment of its establishment it was quite clear that the legal structure itself looked quite strange. Its charter documents initially contained a whole row of inconsistencies, the main of them being clear discrepancies with most important&nbsp;applicable rules of international law &mdash; primarily with its cornerstone, the UN Charter, which contains the fundamentals of the law and order in the post-war world. The UN Charter is to be consulted when developing universal treaties between states, as well as numerous regional and bilateral agreements.</p>
<p>Article 103 of the UN Charter stipulates that its provisions shall prevail over provisions of any other international treaty. According to article 38 of the Statute of the UN International Court of Justice the main source of international law are international treaties (general and special), international conventions, general legal principles.</p>
<p>Yet the Rome Statute provided for its own hierarchy of sources of international law. According to article 21 of the Rome Statute, the Hague Court shall apply, in the first place, &lsquo;this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence&rsquo;; and only in the second place (only where appropriate), &lsquo;applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflicts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thus, the internationally established principles of international law under the UN Charter may be applied by the Hague Court under the 1998 Rome Statute only <em>in the second place</em>, after the Statute and the documents adopted by the Assembly and the Hague Court itself. This way the established quasi-judicial mechanism was given a leeway in the form of the right to ignore the UN Charter and the legal norms enshrined in it. In fact, this distortion of the balance of the applicable international law in the Rome Statute is inadmissible for any sovereign state, including Russia as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>Besides, the notion of &lsquo;general principles of the criminal law&rsquo; used in the Rome Statute is in its essence improper, as it does not differentiate between the national criminal law (the US, for example) and the international law applicable to combating cross-border crime.</p>
<p>All this &lsquo;salad bowl of principles&rsquo; was obviously not in compliance with the national interests of the Russian Federation (or any other sovereign state). Contrary to the identification sometimes applied in the legal science one should differentiate between the Rome Statute, the charter document of the ICC, and the treaties entered into by the USSR and its allies (other superpowers) during the Second World War, starting from the Moscow declarations signed on 30 October 1943. More so that a reference to this Declaration of the four major states can be found in article 106 of the UN Charter. The Agreement entered by and between the governments of the USSR, the USA, Great Britain and France to try the Nazi leaders and organisations accused of war crimes at the London Conference on 8 August 1945 is fundamentally different from the charter of the Hague Criminal Court as well. In terms of their international legal status, by virtue of the UN Charter, the abovementioned documents are <em>above </em>any document passed by the Hague Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Yet those who influenced the development of the ICC were not the least concerned. For instance, flouting of this fundamental political and legal distinction (amalgamation of the former and the latter under the umbrella term &lsquo;international criminal justice&rsquo;) characterised the pro-NATO prosecution of the Serbian leaders in the framework of the so-called International tribunal for prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia after 1991. Russian studies of international law have never admitted this amalgamation⁵. Examples of such inconsistencies are numerous.</p>
<h2>3.</h2>
<p>As a result the ICC judicial practice raised legitimate questions, not only from legal scholars. As time went on the ICC was increasingly demonstrating its dependency on political and ideological factors which in fact shall be excluded from its practice. An obvious inclination was developed towards condemning or pardoning only in the interests of the so-called collective West on the basis of its much favoured double standards. Curious as it may seem, this involved currying favour with a number of states (primarily the USA) which were quite dismissive towards the ICC and its practice. It&rsquo;s understand- able, as in the West there is a tough hierarchy of relations which displayed itself recently in the case of Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant and others, when the European countries being parties to the ICC Statute at first voiced their intention to prosecute Israeli leaders but after a tough rebuke from Washington started talking about the &lsquo;exceptional nature&rsquo; of the case and refused to prosecute the Israeli officials. Strictly speaking, after that the ICC should have chosen to dissolve itself, as it is impossible to imagine a greater contempt.</p>
<p>In general, according to the ICC site, it has considered 33 cases in more than 20 years; some cases are under consideration, including those in respect of several political and military leaders from Africa (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Sudan, Rwanda, Kenya, Libya, C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, Mali, the Central African Re- public). They are accused of tortures, rape, robberies, massacre, kidnapping, destruction of peaceful settlements, abuse of prisoners of war and civilians, including women and children.</p>
<p>Several persons involved in the trials were in fact condemned and imprisoned, primarily immediate perpetrators in a limited number of countries, officials who were testified against. However, a number of high-ranking war criminals went unpunished. The Hague Criminal Court demonstrated discriminatory blindness and hearing loss in their respect.</p>
<p>It is also evident that for many years the ICC has thoroughly considered the cases of indisputably violent yet quite ordinary leaders of ethnic gangs, serial killers and rapists. Up to their elbows in blood of their compatriots, they still were not powerful political figures posing danger to the <em>whole </em>humankind. A question arises: are these &lsquo;warlords&rsquo;, leaders of conflicting African tribes and other criminals real &lsquo;international criminals&rsquo; the <em>national </em>justice cannot cope with?⁶ Was it really necessary to establish such high-priced behemoth as the ICC to restrain and bring them to liability?</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that former Chair of the African Union Commission Jean Ping told journalists that the Court is a toy of declining imperial powers⁷. Opinions spread that apparently the ICC was only interested in prosecuting Africans who confronted the Western influence, and used Africa as a laboratory for testing international criminal jus- tice⁸. It should not go unnoticed that back in 2017 the African Union passed a resolution calling on all African countries to cease cooperation with the ICC in terms of enforcing&nbsp;</p>
<p>arrest warrants for African suspects and to collectively withdraw from the ICC⁹. The fact that the ICC is biased and acts in the interests of a number of Western countries refusing to prosecute persons from the NATO countries was recognised by representa- tives of various continents. For this reason in particular Burundi and the Philippines declared their withdrawal from the Statute&sup1;⁰.</p>
<p>Another thing has attracted attention as well. For an &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; reason the ICC failed to consider events in the countries where justice, peace and humanism were nothing short of a daydream yet where the US and their NATO allies were advancing their interests. Thus, for almost twenty years (from 2001 to 2021) the NATO forces were engaged in active military operations on the territory of Afghanistan, the state which joined the ICC in 2003. According to media reports during all this period they committed actions which could be regarded as crimes of war&sup1;&sup1;. Yet the ICC never did that.</p>
<p>Another example: in November 2017 the then-Prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda, applied to the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber for a permission to initiate investigation of crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by the Afghan opposition group &lsquo;Taliban&rsquo;*, war crimes committed by the Afghan government security forces, and war crimes committed on the territory of Afghanistan starting on 1 May 2003 by US military personnel and CIA officers. After eighteen months of consideration in April 2019 the Pre-Trial Chamber rejected the request, stating that &lsquo;an investigation into the situation in Afghanistan at this stage would not serve the interests of justice&rsquo;&sup1;&sup2;. The Prosecutor appealed to the Appeals Chamber, which in March 2020 reversed the decision&sup1;&sup3;, thus enabling the Prosecutor to initiate preliminary investigation, <em>inter alia </em>in respect of war crimes committed in Afghanistan by US military personnel and citizens.</p>
<p>This was followed by a harsh reaction of the US, which is not a member of the ICC, to the very idea of bringing their military personnel and citizens to liability in an international tribunal. In June 2020 US President Donald Trump declared that the ICC&rsquo;s assertion of jurisdiction over U.S. military, intelligence, and other personnel in the course of investigating actions allegedly committed by those personnel in or relating to Afghanistan &lsquo;constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States&rsquo;&sup1;⁴. Invoking authorities provided in US law the President signed Executive Order 13928, under which the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General, is tasked with identifying any &lsquo;foreign person&rsquo; that, in particular, has directly engaged in the ICC&rsquo;s efforts to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute any United States personnel without the consent of the United States, or has materially assisted, sponsored, or provided&nbsp;financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any ICC efforts described above. Such persons can be subject to having property blocked if that property is under U.S. jurisdiction; in addition, they can be denied entry into the US&sup1;⁵. On 2 September 2020 the US imposed personal sanctions&sup1;⁶ on the Chief Prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda, and Phakiso Mochochoko, the ICC&rsquo;s Director of jurisdiction, complementary and cooperation division&sup1;⁷.</p>
<p>Eventually, despite the newly obtained right to initiate investigation of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Afghanistan the new ICC Prosecutor has not yet charged any US military personnel who participated in the hostilities in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Five years later, having returned to office Donald Trump was quick to reiterate his position towards the ICC. And he didn&rsquo;t limit himself to condemnation. On 6 February 2025 the US President signed an Executive Order which imposed sanctions against the&nbsp;International Criminal Court in response to &lsquo;illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel&rsquo;&sup1;⁸. The US President stated that the conduct of the Court &lsquo;threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States&rsquo;&sup1;⁹. The US threatened to impose &lsquo;tangible and significant consequences&rsquo; on ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members, including the blocking of property and assets and the suspension of entry into the United States&sup2;⁰.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the first person to face sanctions from the newly elected President was Karim Khan, Prosecutor of the ICC, who initiated issuance of an arrest warrant for the Russian President. In his Executive Order Trump, in particular, suspended Karim Khan&rsquo;s entry into the United States, and his property that is in or here- after comes within the territory of the United States, is blocked&sup2;&sup1;.</p>
<h2>4.</h2>
<p>Yet it was in terms of the arrest warrants issued for heads of sovereign states that the ICC reached the pinnacle of nonsense and disutility, including Russia&rsquo;s President Vladimir Putin in respect of the situation in Ukraine&sup2;&sup2;. Passing such decisions the ICC officials were well aware of the fact that they would never bring any practical result, saving propaganda consequences obviously in the interests of the same Anglo-Saxon world.</p>
<p>Judges and officials of the ICC definitely shall not be considered insane or ignorant. These are experienced lawyers, who are well aware of the content of international treaties and the limit of their authority. Yet they have never refused to perform some &lsquo;ideological put-up job&rsquo;, especially when it concerns heads of sovereign states.</p>
<p>Establishing the Hague Criminal Court&sup2;&sup3; the parties to the Rome Statute agreed on a compromise. On the one hand, the Statute stipulates that immunities of the Head of State or another senior official of the state provided by the international law &lsquo;shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person&rsquo; (article 27). On the other hand, in the same document the Court commits itself to &lsquo;obtaining the&nbsp;cooperation&rsquo; of a respective state for the waiver of the immunity of its senior official (article 98).</p>
<p>In fact the Hague Criminal Court without any waiver provided by respective countries introduced the practice of issuing arrest warrants for certain acting heads of sovereign states (non-Western, as a rule). First warrants of this kind were issued in respect of Sudan&rsquo;s head of state Omar al-Bashir (in 2009) and Libya&rsquo;s acting head of state Muammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi (in 2011). The case against al-Gaddafi was terminated upon his death; the arrest warrant for Saif al-Islam al-Gaddafi, his son and companion, the de-facto Prime Minister of Libya, has not been enforced yet, the case being on the stage of pre-trial hearing.</p>
<p>As for Omar al-Bashir, Sudan refused to enforce the Court&rsquo;s warrant, stating that it was a &lsquo;political&rsquo; document which contradicted to the national law, and the ICC itself did not have respective jurisdiction. Nor was the warrant enforced in a number of ICC member states (Malawi, Jordan, Uganda, Chad, the RSA and others) which Omar al-Bashir visited. The legal positions of several countries from this list were considered by the ICC Judicial Divisions, which largely formed the Court&rsquo;s position on immunities of senior officials of the states which are not members of the ICC. The ICC&rsquo;s opinion in this regard was mostly expressed in the decision of the Appeals Chamber concerning Jordan&rsquo;s refusal to surrender Omar al-Bashir.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the ICC, &lsquo;no immunities under customary international law operate in such a situation to bar an international court in its exercise of its own jurisdiction&rsquo;&sup2;⁴. Thus, in essence, the ICC proceeds from the notion that <em>there is no rule </em>of customary international law which would give immunity from arrest and surrender of the head of state which is <em>not party to the Rome Statute </em>by the state which is a member of the Statute on the basis of the request for arrest and surrender issued by the Court&sup2;⁵.</p>
<p>Being rather disputable, this and other assertions caused fair criticism from experts in international law and, naturally, representatives of national justice in various countries.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasise the following. Whatever the interpretations of articles 27 and 98 of the Rome Statute, <em>the very issue of arrest warrants by the Hague Criminal Court for heads of sovereign states shall be qualified as a violation of international law, first of all, the UN Charter</em>. The reasons are as follows.</p>
<p>First, the UN Charter provisions prevail over the Rome Statute, as it was mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Second, the principle of sovereign equality of all UN members is the basis of the UN (article 2). The heads of state represent the respective sovereign governments and by virtue of such basic source of international law as international conventions they &lsquo;enjoy full immunity from jurisdiction in other states, both civil and criminal&rsquo;&sup2;⁶. The violation of this by the Hague Criminal Court is <em>an offence</em>.</p>
<p>Third, the Hague tribunal&rsquo;s encroachment on limitation of the sovereignty of a state (in case of Russia, moreover, a permanent member of the UN Security Council) through pushing towards an arrest of the head of state, thus impeding the performance&nbsp;of respective official functions, shall be also qualified as a violation of international law. First of all, by virtue of the main task of the UN Security Council being maintenance of international peace and security (article 24 of the UN Charter).</p>
<p>Fourth, the Hague Criminal court ignores the obvious fact that three out of five permanent members of the UN Security Council are not parties to the Rome Statute. This decision was at different times taken by China, Russia and the USA. Hence by virtue of article 34 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and customary international law&sup2;⁷ the Rome Statute shall not create any obligations for the states which are not its members (article 34 of the 1969 Convention), including those announced by the Hague Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Fifth, the ICC officials shall understand that trying to limit the activities of the head of state which is a permanent member of the Security Council they attempt to impede the functioning of the UN&rsquo;s main body, which is exclusively responsible for promoting peace. When the international community is fundamentally divided and our planet is on the brink of a third world war, the ICC&rsquo;s decision in itself has increased the global risk. The responsibility for this increasing threat to humanity lies on specific officials of the Hague Criminal Court as well.</p>
<h2>5.</h2>
<p>It is well-known that even before the high-profile &lsquo;political put-up job&rsquo; in respect of Russia&rsquo;s President Vladimir Putin the Hague Criminal Court often had to run quite slippery errands of its clandestine puppet masters. After the 2014 coup in Kyiv aided by the USA&sup2;⁸, refusal of the people of Crimea and Donbass to recognise legitimacy of the coup, constant shelling of Donbass at the direction of Kyiv leaders and de- facto genocide of its population Russia took measures to protect compatriots. Not bothering itself with legal analysis of the abovementioned facts and the applicable law the Hague Criminal Court obligingly supported the &lsquo;legal war&rsquo; against our country waged by the US and their satellites. A very contentious term, the &lsquo;aggression&rsquo;, went into play. By the way, it was included in the ICC jurisdiction only after perennial discussions. By the time the Rome Statute was signed in 1998 the parties had not managed to develop a legally acceptable definition of the term &lsquo;aggression&rsquo;. This issue was submitted to the Assembly, which in 2010 drafted amendments into the Statute. These included definition of a circle of persons liable for this crime and the procedure of bringing them to liability in the Hague Criminal Court. Yet the legal standards introduced were not universal.</p>
<p>Pressurised by the US the Special Military Operation to defend Donbass in the documents of the UN General Assembly was called &lsquo;aggression&rsquo; by the arithmetic majority of states (United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/1 &lsquo;Aggression against Ukraine&rsquo; dated 2 March 2022; United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/2 &lsquo;Humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine&rsquo; dated 24 March 2022 and other documents of the UN General Assembly). Contribution was made by other organisations under Western control, namely the International Monetary&nbsp;Fund (the IMF)&sup2;⁹, the Institute of International Law&sup3;⁰ and others. Finally, in March 2023 the Hague Criminal Court obediently announced the issuance of arrest warrants for the President of the Russian Federation and the Russian Commissioner for children&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>From the legal standpoint this move did not withstand any criticism. The Western countries use the term &lsquo;aggression&rsquo; purely formally, in the meaning assigned to it in the resolution of the 1974 UN General Assembly. According to the resolution, aggression is &lsquo;&hellip; the use of armed force by a State against the <em>sovereignty</em>, territorial integrity or political <em>independence </em>of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations&hellip;&rsquo; which &lsquo;&hellip;gives rise to international responsibility&rsquo;&sup3;&sup1; (emphasis added). Applying this definition to the Special Military Operation, the Western states ignore major issues of the fact and law, first of all, the abovementioned upheaval in Kyiv in 2014 inspired by Washington, which was in obvious violation of article 2 (7) of the UN Charter (on non-interference into a state&rsquo;s internal affairs). After this <em>coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat </em>Ukraine <em>de facto </em>was no longer a sovereign state.</p>
<p>Another circumstance ignored by the West as a whole is that the use of armed forces permissible under the international law (by way of self-defence, including preventive) is not aggression. Yet the main flaw in the international legal position of the Western states is more serious: they ignore the fact that according to the UN Charter establishing the <em>fact of &lsquo;aggression&rsquo; </em>and taking respective actions is <em>only the prerogative of the UN Security Council</em>, including affirmative vote of its five permanent members, but not another body, be it with the UN or not, or another international organisation.</p>
<p>However, the states which are still parties to the Rome Statute did not implement the ICC&rsquo;s decision as well. Russia&rsquo;s President visited one of these countries, Mongolia, early September 2024&sup3;&sup2;. The visit proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere and ended quite successfully. The Hague Criminal Court got almost hysterical. It immediately cracked down on Mongolia, stating that it failed to meet its commitments under the Rome Statute as it had not arrested Russia&rsquo;s President, thus failing to comply with the ICC&rsquo;s cooperation request.</p>
<p>According to the ICC, parties to the Rome Statute shall arrest persons for whom the Court has issued warrants, &lsquo;irrespective of their official status or nationality&rsquo;. In this context the statement made by the ICC that it performs its functions in respect of &lsquo;gross violations of the fundamentals of international law&rsquo;&sup3;&sup3; sounds quite cynical. Yet interfering with the official duties of the head of a sovereign state which is a permanent member of the Security Council the officials of the Hague Criminal Court aggravate the risk of failure to pass decisions in terms of the UNSC reacting to threats to world peace.</p>
<p>In the document of the Hague Criminal Court accusing Mongolia of non-compliance by Mongolia with the request to cooperate under the Rome Statute it is stated that article 98(1) allegedly does not amend article 27(2) or provide for any exceptions, i.e. in the Court&rsquo;s opinion, the Statute does not provide for &lsquo;the waiver of the immunity&rsquo; for heads of sovereign states. According to the Court, any other interpretation would render the obligations of member states &lsquo;senseless&rsquo; and the overall Court&rsquo;s system &lsquo;futile&rsquo;, &lsquo;contrary to the principle of effectiveness (ut res magis valeat quam pereat)&rsquo;&sup3;⁴, stemming from article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, &lsquo;according to which treaties should be interpreted so as to ensure their effective implementation&rsquo;&sup3;⁵. &lsquo;<em>Futility&rsquo; </em>is not to be disputed. The Hague Criminal Court has displayed this quality over and over again.</p>
<p>As for the <em>effectiveness </em>principle, it should be said that the argument given by the Court is distorted. In the course of interpretation of international treaties an interpreter &lsquo;must give meaning and effect to all the terms of the treaty&rsquo; and &lsquo;an interpreter is not free to adopt a reading that would result in reducing whole clauses or paragraphs of a treaty to redundancy or inutility&rsquo;&sup3;⁶.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that earlier the ICC recognised that there is an &lsquo;inherent tension&rsquo; between articles 27(2) and 98(1) of the Statute&sup3;⁷, this tension being substantively analysed in the doctrine&sup3;⁸. All the abovementioned obviously demonstrates legal and technical flaws in the Statute&sup3;⁹, which make this already imperfect instrument absolutely inapplicable.</p>
<p>In its Decision on Mongolia the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber stated that article 34 of the Vienna Convention &lsquo;is irrelevant to the matter at hand (whether the non-member parties are bound by the Statute &ndash; <em>remark</em>), since the Court is not aiming to impose obligations contained in the Statute to non-States Parties, but is rather seeking the cooperation of States Parties in cases against individuals who allegedly committed crimes under article 5 of the Statute on the territory of a State where the Court has jurisdiction&rsquo;. Yet this position is invalid as well: non-provision of immunity by party to the Statute to the head of state which is not party to the Statute is extension of the Statute to such state, as the latter has the right to claim immunities for their senior officials, while the host country has the obligation to grant such immunities. If the latter does not do that by virtue of article 27.2 of the Statute, it shall either be considered to be in violation of customary international law or extending the rule of article 27.2 of the Statute to the third state and its senior officials. There is no third way.</p>
<p>The ICC displayed significant self-confidence when confirmed that &lsquo;any arguable bilateral obligation that Mongolia may owe to the Russian Federation to respect any applicable immunity that international law may allow to Heads of State is not capable of displacing the obligation that Mongolia owes to the Court, which is tasked with exercising its jurisdiction&hellip;⁴⁰. That is true: any international acts are inferior to the Statute, in the opinion of the biased commentators from the Court.</p>
<p>In its correspondence with the Hague Criminal Court Mongolia referred to the customary legal rule of immunities of the heads of states and the International Court of Justice&rsquo;s (&lsquo;ICJ&rsquo;) judgment in the Arrest Warrant case as of 11 April 2000, which confirmed its existence. In response the Hague Court reiterated its position: &lsquo;while personal immunities operate in relations between States, they do not protect individuals, including Heads of State, from prosecution by international criminal courts&rsquo;, justifying this by stating that the ICC &lsquo;is inherently independent of States, strictly impartial and acts in the general interests of the international community&rsquo;⁴&sup1;.</p>
<p>All these arguments are absolutely politicised and legally null and void. Nevertheless, the Court pathetically stated that Mongolia prevented the Court &lsquo;&hellip;from exercising its functions and powers&hellip;&rsquo; and &lsquo;failed to comply with its international obligations under the Statute&hellip;&rsquo;⁴&sup2;, thus rejecting all Mongolia&rsquo;s objections.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that under article 98.2 of the Rome Statute &lsquo;the Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender&rsquo;. The 2019 Treaty on Friendly Relations and Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the Russian Federation and Mongolia (entered into force in September 2020) is applicable in this sense. According to article 4 of this treaty Russia and Mongolia shall &lsquo;abstain from participation in any actions or support of such actions directed against the other party&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All this judicial fuss did not have any significant consequences for Mongolia or Russia. The ICC Assembly decides itself on the measures to be taken against the &lsquo;disobedient&rsquo;. The Statute does not provide for any sanctions against a member state which failed to comprehensively cooperate with the ICC in the course of exercising its functions. In practice such sanctions have never been imposed. The head of Sudan Omar al-Bashir in seven years after the ICC issued its first arrest warrant in 2009 visited more than 20 countries, including the ICC members, yet in none of them was he arrested⁴&sup3;. No measures were taken against these states, although the&nbsp;arrest warrant for Omar al-Bashir was issued in the framework of the case initiated by the UN Security Council (which, unlike the ICC, has the right to apply international legal sanctions).</p>
<p>This proves to what extent the Court and its decisions are futile. Nevertheless, one should not underestimate the scope and possible consequences of the &lsquo;legal war&rsquo; the Western countries continue to fight against Russia using international justice, along with other hostile actions and unlawful restrictions. In essence, the ICC practice is almost ready to <em>legally justify </em>kidnapping officials who enjoy immunities from the territories of the countries which are not parties to the Rome Statute, more so that the ICC has not only become a funnel in which any official of any state may be drawn, in case there is a political order, but also a commonplace tool of political struggle. To say nothing of arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the situation with the beginning of the ICC&rsquo;s investigation into the situation in the Republic of the Philippines and the consequent arrest on 11 March 2025 and surrender to the ICC of the ex-President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte is quite exemplary.</p>
<p>On 15 September 2021 the Pre-Trial Chamber authorised the ICC Prosecutor&rsquo;s in- vestigation of the situation in the Republic of the Philippines in respect of crimes which fall under the ICC jurisdiction which allegedly were committed in the country between 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019 in the framework of the so-called &lsquo;war on drugs&rsquo; campaign⁴⁴. This decision and further events are remarkable in the following respect. First, the ICC did not have jurisdiction <em>ratione temporis </em>in respect of this situation in general, as the investigation was authorised by the Chamber on 15 September 2021, while the Philippines withdrew from the Statute on 17 March 2019. However, this did not prevent the ICC judges from finding the basis for this jurisdiction with reference to its own practice of interpretation of art.127 of the Rome Statute⁴⁵ basing on the principle of &lsquo;if you want it, you can&rsquo;. Second, the arrest and surrender to the ICC of the ex-President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte were not the recognition of the ICC jurisdiction by the Philippines, no longer a party to the Statute, but a surrender by the Marcos clan (Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. is the current President of the Philippines) of their political opponent from the Duterte clan⁴⁶, i.e. the ICC in fact became a tool of clan rivalry in the territory of the Philippines. Thus, media opinion that the authorization of the investigation in the Philippines is &lsquo;casting a dark shadow on the ability of the court to do its job independently&rsquo;⁴⁷ quite accurately reflects the transformation of the very essence of the Court: from an instrument of justice it has turned into an instrument of dirty politics.</p>
<p>It is unclear what lawlessness we will witness further on. The West, which is quickly losing its positions in the world and is not able to impose its will on the majority of the humankind, goes for broke and will stop at nothing. This danger shall be taken into consideration. I, for one, have already speculated on what may follow the enforcement of an illegal decision of the ICC in respect of the head of state which is not party to the ICC. The very enforcement of such decision may be&nbsp;considered as <em>casus belli </em>in respect of the countries which participated in it. It is needless to discuss how dangerous such decisions may be in respect of the head of state of a nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council. To say nothing of the fact that persons in charge of such decisions <em>may and shall </em>be prosecuted by investigative and judicial bodies of the country the head of which is illegally brought to liability.</p>
<h2>6.</h2>
<p>It should be remembered that among countries which accuse Russia of &lsquo;aggression&rsquo; are not only the USA⁴⁸. Similar pronouncements were made by the NATO member states⁴⁹, as well as most members of the Council of Europe and the seven most advanced economies, G7⁵⁰. The African union joined the efforts to accuse Russia of violating the international law, encroachment of &lsquo;territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Ukraine&rsquo;⁵&sup1;.</p>
<p>Yet one should not be satisfied that resolutions of the UN General Assembly are not formally legally binding. In practice in economic arbitration and judicial proceedings against Russia and Russian citizens references to such documents are important for the &lsquo;inner conviction&rsquo; of the judge or arbitrator.</p>
<p>Even ungrounded accusations require exhaustive answer. In this respect I consider it necessary to reiterate our position in respect of the so-called &lsquo;aggression&rsquo; of which the West persistently accuses Russia, and the ICC actions as attempts to give legal effect to these accusations.</p>
<p>Let us summarise the above.</p>
<p><em>First</em>. After the upheaval in 2014 the power in Kyiv was taken by a dependent political regime under full control of the Western countries. Part of former Ukraine, intoxicated and controlled by it, <em>de facto is no longer a sovereign state</em>. Therefore, Russia&rsquo;s defence of Donbass, which did not recognise the coup and was attacked by the illegal 2014 Kyiv government, cannot be legally qualified as &lsquo;aggression&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>. Under the UN Charter establishing the fact of &lsquo;aggression&rsquo; and acting in this respect is the prerogative of the UN Security Council (including affirmative vote of five states which are its permanent members). No other body, be it with the UN or not, or another international organisation have such powers. Their statements are not legally grounded and null.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>. Encroachment of the Hague Criminal Court on limiting sovereignty of a state which is a permanent member of the UN Security Council (demands of the arrest of the head of this state, thus interfering with the official functions) is to be qualified as an offence against international law. Firstly because the UN Security Council bears primary responsibility for maintenance of international peace and security (article 24 of the UN Charter).</p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>. Russia is not party to the Rome statute of 1998, on the basis of which the International Criminal Court was established. In 2016 Russia refused to be party to this international treaty. Therefore, the Statute <em>does not create any obligations </em>for our country.</p>
<p><em>Fifth</em>. The actions of the Hague Criminal Court and its position contradict to the principle of <em>&lsquo;pacta tertiis n</em><em>ес</em><em> nocent nес</em><em> prosunt&rsquo; </em>(a treaty does not create obligations or rights for a third state without its consent) enshrined in customary international law and article 34 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p>
<p><em>Sixth</em>. According to the Rome Statute, the idea behind issuing an arrest warrant is that the ICC requires an opportunity to further oblige the Statute member states, in particular, to arrest the person for whom the warrant has been issued and surrender this person to the Court (article 58 of the Rome Statute). Yet in case this person enjoys immunity as an official of the state which is not party to the Statute, and the Hague Criminal Court has not solicited assistance from such state, issuance of such a war- rant and the Court&rsquo;s request to a member state to arrest the abovementioned person <em>contradict to article 98 of the Statute.</em></p>
<p><em>Seventh</em>. The President of the Russian Federation, being the current head of a sovereign state, <em>is absolutely immune </em>from foreign criminal justice: both <em>ratione materiae</em>⁵&sup2;&nbsp;and <em>ratione personae</em>⁵&sup3;. In case there is no express waiver of this immunity the international judicial bodies have no jurisdiction over the head of the sovereign state.</p>
<p><em>Eighth</em>. According to the judgment of the international Court of Justice dated 14 February 2002 in the case &lsquo;Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000&rsquo;, &lsquo;in international law it is firmly established that, as also diplomatic and consular agents, certain holders of high-ranking office in a State, such as the Head of State, Head of Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs, enjoy immunities from jurisdiction in other States, both civil and criminal&rsquo;⁵⁴. The fact that this rule of international law operates also in cases when there arise a question of possibility of arrest the head of the state which is not party to the Rome Statute by a state which is party to the Rome Statute is recognised in the doctrine as well⁵⁵. Moreover, in one case the ICC recognised the fact there are no exceptions to this rule in respect to the situations when the state operates in its name⁵⁶.</p>
<p>Article 27 of the Rome Statute, in the meaning of which immunities of an official shall not impede jurisdiction in respect of this person, <em>contradicts </em>to the established customary international law. That this document allows for criminal prosecution of cur- rent heads of sovereign states does not comply with fundamental principles of international law enshrined in the UN Charter, firstly, the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members, non-involvement into in the internal politics of another state.</p>
<p><em>Ninth</em>. As of February 2025 125 states are parties to the Rome Statute⁵⁷ (in the UN there are 193 members)⁵⁸. Despite their number, the ICC <em>does not represent the international community of states as a whole and does not act in its name</em>. Three out of five permanent members of the UN Security Council are not parties to it (Russia, China and the USA), along with industrialised and densely populated Asian countries (India, Pakistan, Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia), many Arab countries⁵⁹.</p>
<p><em>Tenth</em>. Judges, prosecutors and other officials who took unlawful decisions may and shall be prosecuted for crimes stipulated in <em>the Russian criminal law</em>.</p>
<h2>7.</h2>
<p>In respect of the position stated above a reasonable question arises: what is in store for the international criminal justice in general? Russian lawyers should voice comprehensive and well-based professional criticism of the ICC decisions at all forums. They should present international legal position of Russia in respect of the Special Military Operation, Ukrainian conflict and other relevant challenging issues to the global legal community, media and people in different countries. They should clarify controversies, and do that actively and incessantly. They should reiterate our commitment to the UN Charter and first of all principles of sovereign equality of all states, non- interference with their internal affairs. They should ensure sure that specific officials of the Hague Criminal Court who violate these principles be taken to liability in accordance with international and Russian national law.</p>
<p>It seems entirely possible to develop on the regional level (for instance, in the framework of BRICS) a concept of establishing an international legal body as an alternative to the Hague Criminal Court. This new judicial body in BRICS could reiterate the common commitment of its member states to the UN Charter principles, including the principles of immunity of heads of sovereign states from any foreign jurisdiction and non-interference into internal affairs of the states, including by way of unlawful foreign instructing of opposition leaders.</p>
<p>As for the ICC, unfortunately, at this point we need to recognise its <em>total inefficiency </em>in performing its main task &ndash; bringing to liability all those guilty of genocide, aggression, war crimes, those who escaped punishment under national law. All of&nbsp;them, including citizens of Western countries and NATO member states. Of course, it is doubtful that the Hague Criminal Court in its present form and role will make efforts to this end. <em>That is why it shall sink into oblivion</em>.</p>
<p>Yet a thirst for justice that unites all people in the world is stronger than any sanctions, pressure, hypocrisy and lies. And the international law developed by the global community is stronger than the rule of force. If the Hague Court is irreversibly flawed at present, the interested states will find an opportunity to establish <em>a different inter- national criminal court </em>which will be spared of these flaws. Its charter shall be based upon all universally recognised rules of international law, including the rule of absolute immunity of senior officials. Its jurisdiction may be extended to the crimes of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and terrorist attacks<strong>. </strong>Such attacks are often pre- pared and committed on the territories of two or more states. International cooperation in the framework of this new body will be able to prevent them.</p>
<p>There is a hope that this new court will be able to attain the goals declared in the Rome Statute of the ICC which the ICC itself proved unable to attain.</p>

<p>&sup1;⁶ Political and legal scholars have not reached consensus over the term &lsquo;sanctions&rsquo; (see: <em>Pyatibratov I. S. </em>Sanctions and unilateral restrictive measures: The problem of delineation of terms and identity of phenomena Gumanitarnye nauki. Vestnik Finansovogo universiteta. 2020. Vol. 10, no. 6. P. 64. (In Russian)). Nevertheless, the use of <em>&ldquo;sanctions&rdquo;</em> in respect of restrictive measures taken by states unilaterally without a respective decision of the UN Security Council has been repeatedly criticised by some scholars (see, for instance: <em>Ryzhova M. V. </em>Economic sanctions in modern international law PhD in Law thesis abstract Kazan. P. 8. (In Russian); <em>Kritskiy K. V. </em>The terms <em>&ldquo;international sanctions&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;unilateral restrictive measures&rdquo;</em>. Moskovskii zhurnal mezhdunarodnogo prava. 2016. No. 2. P. 2. (In Russian); <em>Kritskiy K. V. </em>Sanctions and unilateral restrictive measures in modern international law PhD in Law thesis Moscow. P. 10. (In Russian); <em>Alekseeva D. G., Alimova Y. O., Barzilova I. S. </em>Law under sanctions / M. V. Mazhorina, B. A. Shakhnazarov (eds). Moscow, Prospekt Publ. P. 93&ndash;94. (In Russian). This criticism is justified: while the term <em>&ldquo;sanction&rdquo;</em> is viewed as a coercive measure applied in the case of an offence, i.e. a lawful measure, restrictive measures applied by states unilaterally without a decision of the UN Security Council are not always lawful. In this respect, it is at least inaccurate to call the latter &lsquo;sanctions&rsquo; in the legal sense. It is no coincidence that coercive measures adopted by the UN Security Council are often called &lsquo;sanctions&rsquo; in UN documents, while regimes created by these measures are called &lsquo;sanctions regimes&rsquo; (see: Document A/56/10: Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-third session (23 April &ndash; 1 June and 2 July &ndash; 10 August 2001) // Yearbook of the International Law Commission. 2001. Vol. II. P. 2. p. 78; Resolution 2170 (2014), adopted by the Security Council at its 7242nd meeting, on 15 August 2014 (S/RES/2170). Available at: <a href=""https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/777420/files/S_RES_2170%282014%29-RU.pdf?ln=ru"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/777420/files/S_RES_2170%282014%29-RU.pdf?ln=ru</a> (accessed: 06.03.2025); Subsidiary Organs of the United Nations Security Council // Fact Sheets.

On the contrary, in certain UN acts the term &lsquo;sanctions&rsquo; is not used to refer to unilateral coercive measures (see, for instance, Resolution <em>&ldquo;Human rights and unilateral coercive measures&rdquo;</em>, adopted by the General Assembly on 19 December 2016 (A/RES/71/193). Available at: <a href=""https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/857550/files/A_RES_71_193-RU.pdf?ln=ru"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/857550/files/A_RES_71_193-RU.pdf?ln=ru</a> (accessed: 06.03.2025)). Nevertheless, in political and journalistic discourses such measures are sometimes referred to as <em>&ldquo;sanctions&rdquo;</em> (see: <em>Gevorgyan K. </em><em>&ldquo;Unilateral Sanctions&rdquo;</em> and International Law // The International Affairs. Available at: <a href=""https://interaffairs.ru/jauthor/material/720"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">https://interaffairs.ru/jauthor/material/720</a> (accessed: 06.03.2025). (In Russian)). In this article, for the sake of convenience, the term <em>&ldquo;sanctions&rdquo;</em> is used inter alia to define unilateral coercive measures applied by states without a decision of the UN Security Council.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I think Russia is ready&hellip; I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelensky,&rdquo;</em> Trump told journalists at the White House on Wednesday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>And I hope that Zelensky&hellip; I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelensky &ndash; so far it&rsquo;s been harder.</em></strong></p>

<p>The US has been pushing for a resolution to the conflict, while also seeking to secure a minerals extraction agreement with Ukraine to help offset the billions of dollars it has spent supplying weapons and aid.</p>
<p>However, Trump and his administration have grown increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of negotiations on both fronts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned on Tuesday that if progress stalls, the US may walk away from the talks. <em>&ldquo;If not enough movement is happening, we may need to move on to other priorities,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also voiced Trump&rsquo;s frustration with Zelensky. <em>&ldquo;Unfortunately, Zelensky has been trying to litigate this peace negotiation in the press, and that&rsquo;s unacceptable to the president,&rdquo;</em> Leavitt said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that a peace deal with Ukraine is unlikely to be concluded in an expedited manner due to the complexities of the negotiations.

470,RT English,Smoke in Rome: What’s really cooking between Trump and Tehran?,https://www.rt.com/news/616159-smoke-in-rome-trump-tehran/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS,2025-04-23 19:46:59,"<p><strong>While US negotiators trade smiles with Tehran, internal rifts and foreign pressure reveal just how fragile Washington’s position has become</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Last Saturday, the second round of US-Iran nuclear talks took place in Rome, following an initial meeting held a week&nbsp;before in Muscat, Oman. Both sides had described the talks as <em>&ldquo;constructive,&rdquo;</em> but that optimism quickly collided with a wave of conflicting signals from the Trump administration. Despite the encouraging tone, it remained unclear whether a new nuclear agreement was truly within reach.</p>
<p>At the outset of negotiations, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz &ndash; an outspoken Iran hawk &ndash; laid down a hardline condition: Iran must completely dismantle its uranium enrichment program if it wanted any deal with the US. But after the Muscat meeting, Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who led the US delegation, struck a very different note. In an interview with Fox News, he suggested that Tehran might be allowed to maintain limited uranium enrichment for peaceful energy purposes &ndash; something that would have been a nonstarter just days earlier.</p>
<p>Witkoff emphasized the importance of strict verification protocols to prevent any militarization of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear capabilities, including oversight of missile technology and delivery systems. Notably absent from his remarks? Any mention of <em>&ldquo;dismantlement.&rdquo;</em> This shift hinted that the administration might be considering a modified return to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) &ndash; the very agreement that Trump tore up in 2018, branding it a <em>&ldquo;disaster.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>But the pivot didn&rsquo;t last. Just one day later, Witkoff reversed course in a post on X, doubling down on the demand for full dismantlement of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear and weapons programs. So what triggered the rhetorical whiplash?</p>
<p>According to Axios, Trump huddled with top national security officials just three days after the Muscat talks to reassess the US strategy. In that meeting, Vice President JD Vance, Witkoff, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth argued for a pragmatic approach. Pushing Tehran to dismantle its entire nuclear infrastructure, they warned, would tank the talks. Iran had already made it clear that such sweeping concessions were off the table. Vance even suggested Washington should brace for some level of compromise.</p>
<p>But not everyone agreed. A rival faction &ndash; led by Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio &ndash; saw things differently. They argued that Iran&rsquo;s current vulnerability gave the US a unique upper hand, one that shouldn&rsquo;t be squandered. If Tehran failed to meet America&rsquo;s terms, they insisted, the US should be ready to strike militarily or greenlight Israeli action.</p>

    </blockquote>


    

<p>The divide exposes a deeper strategic rift within the Trump administration. Between the maximalist view that Iran must be completely disarmed and the more flexible position that aims to curb weaponization while preserving peaceful enrichment lies a vast gray area. The lack of a unified message &ndash; or even basic consensus &ndash; risks leaving the US at a disadvantage against a seasoned and coordinated Iranian negotiating team.</p>
<p>In short, Trump finds himself in a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it&rsquo;s clear he wants to avoid military escalation. The decision to send Witkoff &ndash; a figure known for his willingness to compromise &ndash; signals a genuine interest in diplomacy over saber-rattling. If hardliners had the upper hand in Washington, it&rsquo;s unlikely the second round in Rome would have happened at all.</p>
<p>On Monday, April 21, Trump cautiously told reporters the talks were going <em>&ldquo;very well,&rdquo;</em> but warned that real progress would take time. His choice of words reflected a desire to stay flexible, while acknowledging the complexity &ndash; and risks &ndash; of negotiating with Tehran.</p>
<p>Optimism seems more palpable on the Iranian side. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the two sides had found significantly more common ground in Rome than in Muscat. His remarks suggest that momentum is building and that real progress may be on the horizon.</p>
<p>Araghchi&rsquo;s itinerary also raised eyebrows. Before heading to Rome, he made a stop in Moscow, where he met with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He reportedly carried a personal message from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei &ndash; what he called <em>&ldquo;a message to the world.&rdquo;</em> The West didn&rsquo;t miss the symbolism: the visit was widely interpreted as a public reaffirmation of the Moscow&ndash;Tehran alliance. Retired US Army Colonel and former Pentagon advisor Douglas MacGregor noted on X that any major American military action against Iran would likely draw a response from Russia, Tehran&rsquo;s strategic partner.</p>
<p>On that same day, President Putin signed a law ratifying a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Iran &ndash; further cementing political and economic cooperation. Against the backdrop of fragile US-Iran talks, the Moscow-Tehran axis suddenly looks more consequential. With these growing ties, Washington may find it harder to exert unilateral pressure on Iran.</p>

    </blockquote>


    

<p>Meanwhile, not everyone in Tehran is sold on the negotiations. Many Iranian officials remain skeptical of Trump, whose decision to unilaterally scrap the JCPOA in 2018 still looms large. Their distrust extends beyond Trump himself to a broader concern: that future US presidents may once again reverse course. If Obama&rsquo;s deals were dismantled by Trump, why wouldn&rsquo;t Trump&rsquo;s agreements suffer the same fate?</p>
<p>Despite these tensions, major international outlets have confirmed that two more rounds of talks are planned: one in Geneva next week, and another in Oman the week after. The continued diplomatic activity points to a shared interest in keeping the conversation alive. For now, both Trump&rsquo;s measured optimism and Iran&rsquo;s cautious tone suggest that, at least in the near term, the risk of war has receded.</p>
<p>This de-escalation in rhetoric reflects a deeper truth: despite lingering mistrust and domestic political pressures, both sides see value in staying at the table. You don&rsquo;t have to be a policy wonk to see that. But in Israel, the mood is far more anxious. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &ndash; never one to hide his skepticism about engaging Iran &ndash; has condemned the talks. For Tel Aviv, negotiations risk softening Tehran&rsquo;s isolation and threatening Israel&rsquo;s strategic position.</p>
<p>Still, Trump&rsquo;s priority isn&rsquo;t regional politics &ndash; it&rsquo;s his legacy. He wants to be seen as the president who avoided war and brokered a deal the American public can get behind. In that light, Netanyahu&rsquo;s objections may have to wait.</p>",Mixed,positive

<p><em><strong>The situation for Ukraine is dire &ndash; He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country.</strong></em></p>

<p>Trump reiterated that Zelensky has a weak bargaining position in the negotiations. <em>&ldquo;We are very close to a Deal, but the man with &lsquo;no cards to play&rsquo; should now, finally, GET IT DONE,&rdquo;</em> he wrote.</p>

<p>The US has been pushing for a&nbsp; resolution to the conflict, while at the same time trying to secure a minerals extraction deal with Ukraine to recoup some of the billions of dollars spent on&nbsp;arming&nbsp;the country. However, Trump and his administration have been growing impatient with the pace of the negotiations on both fronts, signaling that they may abandon the efforts.</p>
<p>If the US determines that <em>&ldquo;not enough movement is happening, we may need to move on to other priorities,&rdquo;</em> Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview with the Free Press published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated in response that a peace deal with Ukraine is unlikely to be concluded in an expedited manner due to the complexities of the negotiations. Moscow has said it has always been ready to engage in peace talks, provided they ensure a permanent solution that addresses the root causes of the conflict &ndash; while any temporary ceasefire would be used by Ukraine&rsquo;s Western backers to rearm the country&rsquo;s military.</p>",Mixed,positive

            <p>The EU has firmly rejected the idea of easing Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia before peace negotiations are concluded, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing sources.</p>
<p>Last week, the US shared with EU officials proposals aimed at facilitating a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. The initiative reportedly outlined potential terms to end the conflict, including the easing of sanctions on Moscow in the event of a lasting ceasefire.</p>
<p>Brussels, however, <em>&ldquo;staunchly opposes&rdquo;</em> Russia&rsquo;s request to lift EU sanctions before peace talks are concluded, Reuters wrote, citing European diplomats. Another sticking point is the US proposal to recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea &ndash; a suggestion the outlet described as a <em>&ldquo;non-starter&rdquo;</em> for both the EU and Kiev.</p>
<p>The EU&rsquo;s stance is reportedly seen as diminishing the chances of any breakthrough in the peace negotiations, prompting senior US officials to skip a high-level meeting in London on Wednesday held for discussing the Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p>The gathering was due to include top diplomats from the UK, US, France, Germany, and Ukraine but ended up being downgraded to involve lower-level officials.</p>

<p>Both special envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are skipping the event. The US delegation is instead being led instead by General Keith Kellogg, another envoy of US President Donald Trump focused on Ukraine.</p>
<p>Last month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared the EU would not lift its sanctions against Russia for as long as the Ukraine conflict continues. Also in March, the EU rejected a Russian demand to lift sanctions on Russian Agricultural Bank as part of the Black Sea ceasefire initiative discussed between Moscow and Washington. During the talks in Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US agreed to work toward reviving the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which, according to the Kremlin, would include the removal of Western restrictions against the agricultural bank and other financial institutions.</p>

<p>Two major priorities of the Trump agenda include slashing government spending on programs deemed unnecessary and concluding the Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p>The efforts to resolve the conflict reportedly reached a critical juncture this week, with Washington anticipating reactions from Kiev and European NATO members regarding its proposed compromise ceasefire deal before presenting it to Moscow. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cautioned last week that the US could <em>&ldquo;move on&rdquo;</em> to other issues if the negotiations stall.</p>
<p>Neither Rubio nor Trump&rsquo;s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who outlined the ideas last week at a gathering in Paris, will attend this week&rsquo;s discussions with Ukrainian officials in London, according to Axios. However, Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow for follow-up talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that the US is proposing formal recognition of Russian sovereignty over the former Ukrainian region of Crimea, which voted to join Russia following the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev. Ukraine&rsquo;s Vladimir Zelensky has rejected this, reiterating on Tuesday that Kiev&rsquo;s claim to the peninsula is non-negotiable.</p>",Mixed,negative

480,Politico Europe,An ugly Ukraine deal was predictable — but this will merely pause Russia’s revanchism,https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-voloymyr-zelensyy-russia-ukraine-deal-revanchism/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication,2025-04-29 02:02:00,"<p><em>Jamie Dettmer is opinion editor at POLITICO Europe.</em><em></em></p>



<p>Donald Trump will complete his first 100 days in office this week. But despite the U.S. president&#8217;s campaign boast about how easily he could settle the Ukraine war in just one day, he still hasn’t managed to broker a ceasefire — let alone a deal to permanently end the conflict.</p>



<p>His administration seems hopeful that will change this week. But if the U.S. does manage to engineer a ceasefire, there should be grave doubts it will be the final word on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s revanchism.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“<a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20z20kyvxxo"" target=""_blank"">We’re close, but we’re not close enough</a>,” said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio this weekend, emphasizing the Trump administration is ready to “walk away” if there’s no breakthrough — a threat his boss has also made.</p>



<p>Yet, Washington’s tone remains upbeat in the wake of <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/sacraments-side-chats-pope-francis-funeral-trump-dealmaking-von-der-leyen-zelenskyy-putin-ukraine-war/"">Trump’s 15-minute discussion with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral. It was the first time they’d met since their nasty Oval Office spat in February.</p>



<p>Both leaders said the encounter was productive, and Zelenskyy hailed it as <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zelenskyy.official/posts/pfbid02XY4kH5cj2whLLRmwzijwoaactPkkXshgYgJzYeGEi5cKR9aF1j9ARiXv2CXwhJ11l"" target=""_blank"">potentially “historic</a>.” Meanwhile, Washington also described last week’s meeting between Putin and Trump’s Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff as productive.</p>



<p>But the U.S. president’s frustration has been building.</p>



<p>Since taking office, he’s been bullying Zelenskyy, blaming him for the war, while playing much nicer with the much less vulnerable Russian leader who actually started the conflict. Witkoff, for his part, has been happily repeating Kremlin talking points, and waxed lyrical about Putin praying for Trump upon learning of the assassination attempt on his life last July.</p>



<p>Last week, however, Trump offered a rare public rebuke of Putin, after the deadliest Russian attack on Ukraine’s capital since last summer. “<a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/24/trump-putin-ceasefire-negotiations-00307270"" target=""_blank"">Vladimir, STOP!</a>” the U.S. president posted on Truth Social, saying he was “not happy” with the assault. He then <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/04/26/trump-suggests-russia-could-face-secondary-sanctions-as-he-accuses-putin-of-tapping-him-along-over-ukraine-war/"" target=""_blank"">threatened Russia with sanctions</a> after his meeting with Zelenskyy in St Peter’s Basilica.</p>



<p>So, is this rare reproach and economic threat responsible for some sort of shift in Moscow? Is that the reason Trump and his aides believe they’re nearer a deal? Or is Zelenskyy the one caving?</p>



<p>No matter what, a healthy dose of skepticism remains in order. Russia&#8217;s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov appeared to <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/kremlin-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy-donald-trump-kremlin-crimea-ukraine/"">harden Moscow&#8217;s position on annexed territories in eastern Ukraine</a>  in an interview this weekend. And we’ve heard optimistic noises from the Trump administration about the proximity of a deal before. Further caution is also advisable, as the deal’s broad contours have not actually shifted much: It still includes Ukraine never joining NATO, effectively ceding much of the territory Russia has occupied, U.S. recognition of the Crimean peninsula, and lifting sanctions on Russia.</p>



<p>The U.S. position is that in return, Ukraine will be given a “robust security guarantee” by European countries and other friendly states acting as guarantors, but the details on that are murky. And in addition to deeper energy and economic cooperation between the U.S. and Russia, Kyiv will have to sign a minerals deal giving the U.S. half of the revenue from its natural resources, while the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant — controlled by Kyiv but operated by the U.S. — will have to supply both Ukraine and Russia with electricity.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-6529803"" height=""700"" src=""https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/28/12949390-1024x700.jpg"" width=""1024"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">There will be no accountability for documented Russian war crimes, nor will there be any clear compensation from Moscow. | Sergey Dolzhenko/EPA-EFE</figcaption></figure>



<p>There is no doubt this is a terrible deal for Ukraine. The bloodletting may halt, but not only will Kyiv emerge from this brutal war dismembered, it will also have no credible security guarantee, as Washington is declining to backstop the Europeans. There will be no accountability for documented Russian war crimes, nor will there be any clear compensation from Moscow, as far as we know, for the damage it inflicted. (While the latter is included in the text, there&#8217;s no explanation of where the money will come from — or how much.)</p>



<p>This is hardly <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-reviews-plan-halt-us-military-aid-ukraine-unless-it-negotiates-peace-with-2024-06-25/"" target=""_blank"">the “peace through strength” strategy</a> that Trump’s increasingly sidelined Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg had outlined: “We tell the Ukrainians, ‘You’ve got to come to the table, and if you don’t come to the table, support from the United States will dry up.’ And you tell Putin, ‘He’s got to come to the table and if you don’t come to the table, then we’ll give Ukrainians everything they need to kill you in the field,’” Kellogg had said.</p>



<p>But only half of that equation was put into effect. Ukraine is the only party making concessions. Furthermore, this will mark the first time in postwar history that European borders will be redrawn by force of arms — a bad precedent in itself.</p>



<p>Trump aides do have a point, however, when they argue it’s been clear Ukraine would have to cede some territory. This column has argued the war was unwinnable for Ukraine for the past two years, and has been critical of the West’s promises to stick with Ukraine until its 1991 borders are restored.</p>



<p>There was, of course, a moment when this might not have been the case — if the West hadn’t dithered at the start of the war. “Russian troops could have been defeated and expelled from Ukraine back in 2022, if the West had initially taken a tough stance toward Russia, and Ukraine had received the necessary amount of weapons,” explained former Russian diplomat Boris Bondarev.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But once the West chose to be afraid, the “as long as it takes” mantra was always suspect, as was the frequent assertion that no one should push Ukraine into talks because whoever pays the piper calls the tune. The promise of NATO membership was also a folly, as it was clear Moscow would never allow that to happen.</p>



<p>Far too much hope was placed in economic sanctions, which were never likely to bring Russia to heel. Plus, attritional war always favored Russia, especially as there was no chance Western allies would enter the war as combatants.</p>



<p>In short, an ugly deal was predictable. <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/west-us-nato-promises-to-ukraine-were-never-going-to-be-kept-donald-trump-russia-war/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">If you run down your military forces and arms production for decades</a>, fail to draw enforceable red lines and don’t ask hard questions before making promises, this is what happens.</p>



<p>This means Putin’s thuggishness will be rewarded, and there will be no accountability for his army’s atrocious behavior or the unlawful, detestable deportations to Russia from occupied parts of Ukraine. Additionally, the axis of autocrats will be emboldened in their determination to smash the old global order.</p>



<p>More devastatingly, it also means Ukraine will be the punished party — not Russia. And without a U.S.-backed security guarantee, the ceasefire deal will be as worthless as the notorious 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which fixed Ukraine’s borders and underwrote its sovereignty in exchange for the country relinquishing its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal. Putin didn’t observe Russia’s 1994 commitments, and it is unlikely he&#8217;ll abide by the proposed deal now.</p>



<p>As Ukraine’s former Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov noted to POLITICO last year: “They may sign documents, but whether they keep to agreements is another matter. <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-ukraine-ready-peace-russia-war/"">Remember the Budapest Memorandum. French President Mitterrand refused to add his signature </a>… and warned our president [Leonid Kuchma], ‘Young man, they will trick you.’ Kuchma told me this story. After 30 years, the Russians did just that — they tricked us.”</p>



<p>And without security guarantees and a firm “porcupine strategy” to make sure Ukraine will be heavily armed and even more dangerous to mess with, there’s a trick here too. The deal will likely spell the end of Zelenskyy’s presidency and throw Ukraine into political turmoil over the deal, as ceding territory will likely require a constitutional amendment and referendum.</p>



<p>Putin will then have plenty of opportunity to exploit these political divisions, making the deal just a way station in his revanchist bid to subjugate the country.</p>",Mixed,negative
